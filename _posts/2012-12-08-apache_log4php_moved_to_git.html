<p>I'm pleased to announce that Apache log4php project has finished it's move from Subversion to Git version control system.</p>
<p>Links to the available repositories are as follows:</p>
<p>The official repository (and web interface), writable for developers:<br />
<a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/logging-log4php.git">https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/logging-log4php.git</a></p>
<p>Official read-only mirror:<br />
<a href="git://git.apache.org/logging-log4php.git">git://git.apache.org/logging-log4php.git</a></p>
<p>Github read-only mirror:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4php">https://github.com/apache/logging-log4php</a></p>
<p>The exact workflow is still under discussion, however it will probably be based heavily on the <a target="_blank" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a>.</p>
<p>We believe this will allow us to function better as an open source project, and accept user contributions more easily.</p>
