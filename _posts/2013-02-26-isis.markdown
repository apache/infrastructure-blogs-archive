<p>Mylaensys have just publicised on <a href="http://blog.mylaensys.com/2013/02/about-apache-isis.html">their blog</a> the fact that they are working on an integration between&nbsp;<a href="http://dhtmlx.com/">DHTMLX</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://isis.apache.org">Apache Isis</a>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They previously have integrated DHTMLX&nbsp;and Spring Framework (<a href="http://www.mylaensys.com/dhtmlx-spring-integration.html">DHTMLX Spring Link</a>), so they have a proven track record... and I've been impressed how quickly they've produced some early prototypes.</p>
  <p>If the idea of rapidly building domain-driven apps with a customizable UI appeals, then keep an eye on their progress through the Apache <a href="http://isis.apache.org/support.html">Isis mailing lists</a>.
