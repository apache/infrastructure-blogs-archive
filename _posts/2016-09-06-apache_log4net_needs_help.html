    project authors used Coverity to check the earlier versions of Apache HTTP Server.
    The recent check, however, hasn't revealed any signs of the code being analyzed
    by other tools. The project's code is of high quality, though PVS-Studio still
    managed to find a few interesting errors.\r\n\r\nWe already checked the project
    in 2011. For information about the bugs found during that check, see the article
    \"Leo Tolstoy and static code analysis\".\r\n\r\nThe recent analysis was done
    with PVS-Studio, version 6.08."

  content: "I tried everything on my suse 11 installation to turn logging for access_log
    off with no success first. the thing was, that commenting out mod_log_config in
    httpd.conf stoped logging the message but i still got for every message a line
    \"combined\" in my access_log file. after a bit digging i found the CustomLog
    directive in /etc/apache2/sysconfig.d/global.conf but editing this file is useless
    because it is created on startup. finaly i found the position to disable logging
    for access_log in the file /etc/sysconfig/apache2 put a # in front of\r\n\r\nAPACHE_ACCESS_LOG=\"/var/log/apache2/access_log
    combined\"\r\n\r\nHope i could help some suse users."

<p>This is a general call-to-arms for everyone who uses log4net as their<br />
logging solution. If log4net is the logging framework that you are<br />
using and would like to keep using in the future it is time now to get<br />
involved. The project needs a larger developing community to move on!<br />
We really need more people who want to shape the future of log4net at<br />
the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>In all the time since log4net has been started by Nicko Cadell more<br />
than ten years ago, there have never been more than two or three<br />
people regularly contributing to it. As is normal in open source<br />
projects people have come and gone when their interests or just the<br />
amount of time they could invest have changed.</p>
<p>At the moment Dominik Psenner and Stefan Bodewig are the only people<br />
semi-actively working on log4net and neither of them is able to devote<br />
as much time to the project as they'd like to and as would be<br />
required.</p>
<p>Realistically log4net is maintenance mode where development of new<br />
features is not going to happen.</p>
<p>This has repeatedly made log4net lag behind recent developments in the<br />
.NET world. It took a long time to get a version out that properly<br />
worked with .NET 4.0 in 2011 and adaptions to .NET 4.5 also took much<br />
longer than many users would have wished. We are seeing it again with<br />
.NET Core right now. In addition there are many unresolved issues in<br />
log4net's JIRA.</p>
<p>Despite this there are more than 2500 downloads of the logging<br />
framework every day from nuget. We are asking you, the log4net<br />
community, to get your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Right now we are in the process of creating a log4net release that<br />
works for .NET Core. It is a very targeted effort and it is very<br />
unlikely Dominik and Stefan will be able to contribute more in the<br />
future than we did during the past months.</p>
<p>If you are willing to help, please join log4net's dev mailing list and<br />
raise your hand. Look through log4net's issue tracker and pick things<br />
you'd like to work on. If you don't know where to start, please ask,<br />
Dominik and Stefan will be there to help.</p>
<p>If there is anything holding you back from contributing, let's discuss<br />
it and get it out of the way. Nothing is carved into stone, neither<br />
what the future of log4net holds nor how we make it happen.</p>
