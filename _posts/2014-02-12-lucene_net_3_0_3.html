  content: "@BillMiller - Yes, the java and .NET indexes are interchangeable.  For
    example, if you create an index using Lucene.Net, you can easily open it back
    up using Luke, a java based index viewer.\r\n\r\n@David - The spatial library
    was updated to the latest version, corresponding to version 3.6 or 4.0 of Java
    Lucene.  The spatial module was completely rewritten and that class was removed.
    I recall there being lots of issues with the Spatial library around version 2.9/3.0,
    so it was replace with the version we've just recently ported."

    which was present in previous version of lucene.Net 2.9.2.\r\nAlso after searching
    on &ldquo;lucene.appache.org&rdquo;, I came to know that &ldquo;ParallelMultiSeacher&rdquo;
    class has been depreciated .\r\n\r\nInstead of that we can use &ldquo;\r\n\r\nIndexSearcher(IndexReader
    r, ExecutorService executor)&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut I m unable to find IndexSearcher
    constructor with &ldquo;ExecutorService&rdquo; as its parameter. Also I m unable
    to find interface &ldquo;ExecutorService&rdquo; in lucene.Net 3.0.3.\r\n\r\nCan
    you please tell me how can I use &ldquo;ParallelMultiSearcher&rdquo; using lucene.Net
    3.0.3  or is there any alternative to do that and how?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks And Regards,\r\nMohit

    \r\n\r\nI know you're horribly busy but if you want to make sure that people find
    your latest work and support your efforts, be sure to link to the latest resources
    from the old ones that haven't been updated in years. \r\n\r\nI don't know if
    you realise it but when people find old, out of date resources, they conclude
    that your project is dead.\r\n\r\nGlad to see you're still working on Lucene.Net

<p>
Apache Lucene.Net 3.0.3 just passed a vote for release - our first official release since graduating from the incubator in August. A lot of work was put into porting and testing the code. We've brought back .Net 3.5 support and added an entirely new Spatial Contrib project. </p>
