<p>
The Apache NetBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 Beta.</p>
<p>
Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta (incubating) constitutes all the modules in the Apache NetBeans Git repo, which together provide the NetBeans Platform (i.e., the underlying application framework), which was released as Apache NetBeans 9.0 Alpha (incubating), as well as all the modules that provide the Java SE-related features of Apache NetBeans. In short, Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta (incubating) is a full IDE for Java SE development.</p>
<p>
See the below for the donation status of features that have not been donated to Apache yet, e.g., features for working with Java EE, JavaScript, PHP, C/C++, and more:</p>

<b>Note:</b> Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 Beta is primarily focused on IP clearance. Its functionality has not been tested &mdash; the NetCAT (NetBeans Community Acceptance Testing) process will begin now that Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 Beta has been released. Watch this space for upcoming announcements about NetCAT. When NetCAT completes, we will vote on the final release of Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0.</p>
