<meta name="description" content="FOUNDATION OPERATIONS SUMMARY October-December 2014 &quot;The Apache Software Foundation is a cornerstone of the modern open source software ecosystem &ndash; supporting some of the most widely used and important software solutions powering today&rsquo;s Internet economy...&quot; &ndash;Mark Driver, Research Vice President, Gartner Group &gt; The Place for Open Innovation and Collaboration: A recent recount of the the ASF&#39;s projects and initiatives revealed that the number exceeds 350, including 160 Top-level Projects, 110 sub-projects (not in the original census), 36 podlings in the Apache Incubator, and 39 technical initiatives in the Apache Labs. New projects that have entered the Apache Incubator are: Corinthia (CMS), Htrace (Big Data), Ignite (Big Data), Kylin (Big Data), Lens (Big Data), NiFi (Cloud Computing), SAMOA (Big Data), Tamaya (Java Tools/Frameworks), Taverna (Workflow Management), and Zeppelin (Big Data Analytics). Podlings that graduated the Incubator as Apache Top-Level Projects are: DeviceMap, Drill, Falcon, and MetaModel. Hadoop Development Tools retired from the Incubator. We distributed formal press releases to support the above milestones, and have conducted regular outreach to members of the media and analyst community, and to the community at-large through the new weekly Apache News Round-Up reports via email to announce@apache.org. To help developers and users identify their affiliation with products and initiatives under the Apache umbrella, we provided new &quot;Powered by Apache&quot; graphical assets for all Apache projects http://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/#poweredby &gt; Apache Community: &quot;Community Over Code&quot; is the cornerstone of the Foundation&#39;s core tenets, underscoring open collaboration amongst the ASF&#39;s 500+ Members and 4,500+ Committers through respectful, honest, technically-focused interaction. We participated in Google Summer of Code for the 9th consecutive year: of the initial 42 students accepted, 36 passed the midterm evaluations and 35 passed the final evaluations. ApacheCon, the Foundation&#39;s official user conference, trainings, and expo was held in 17-21 November 2014 in Budapest, Hungary. Preparations are underway for ApacheCon North America (13-17 April 2015/Austin, Texas), including soliciting presentations and processing travel assistance applications. In addition, the Lucene/Solr and CloudStack communities will be co-locating conference events during ApacheCon. &gt; Contributions and License Agreements: We received and filed 198 Individual CLAs, 18 Corporate CLAs, and 8 software grants. &gt; Infrastructure: Over the past quarter, the ASF Infrastructure team has largely been focused on automation and paying down some long standing technical debt. Much of the focus has been on covering the spread of configuration management over our core services. Thanks to several Infrastructure sponsors, we have been able to move move a number of services into the public Cloud. Of course, there are a number of project and user facing changes taking place as well; we&#39;ve debuted a code signing service to give our projects&#39; end users a better installation experience while making them more secure. We&#39;ve also dramatically improved our CI platform, adding much additional capacity and capability in the form of more static slaves, the ability to spin up on-demand slaves as well as Docker containers. Apache Infrastructure contractors work tirelessly around the globe and around the clock to ensure our distributed project teams can continue to work without worrying about the services they depend upon. ASF Infrastructure averaged 99.39% overall uptime, as detailed at http://s.apache.org/uptime &gt; Budget: As ASF sponsorship funds are a critical part of ensuring we can support all Apache projects, Infrastructure accounts for our largest expense at 63% of our current budget. 10% of our budget is allocated to Marketing &amp; Publicity, where our contractor ensures prompt and appropriate responses to all inquiries. An additional 10% is spent on general administration, comprising legal and bank fees, insurances, executive assistant, accounting services, and associated expenses. 5% is dedicated to ASF Brand Management to ensure Apache brands remain independent of any individual commercial interests through trademark registration and related activities.
