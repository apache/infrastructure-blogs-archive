<p>There will be a planned reboot of Jira on Friday 7th August at 00:00 UTC.</p>
<p>This is 72 hours notice as recommended in our Core Services planned downtime SLA.</p>
<p>Currently, Jira requires a reboot when adding new projects to it. There is an outstanding <br />ticket with Atlassian about this. They require logs and so these will be gathered at the <br />time of the planned reboot. </p>
<p>Projects being added to Jira at this time will include:-</p>
<p>INFRA-9713 - Whimsy</p>
<p>and any more that get requested between now and downtime.</p>
<p>Any projects requiring issues to be imported from other issue trackers will NOT be done at <br />this time.</p>
<p>A tweet via @infrabot will be tweeted 24 hrs and 1 hr before.<br />A planned maintenance notice will be posted on status.apache.org.</p>
<p>Actual downtime should be no more than 10 minutes all being well.</p>
<p>The next email about this will be after the service has resumed from the planned downtime.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Geoff Corey</p>
