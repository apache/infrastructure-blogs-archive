<p>This is a general call-to-arms for everyone who uses log4net as their<br />
logging solution. If log4net is the logging framework that you are<br />
using and would like to keep using in the future it is time now to get<br />
involved. The project needs a larger developing community to move on!<br />
We really need more people who want to shape the future of log4net at<br />
the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>In all the time since log4net has been started by Nicko Cadell more<br />
than ten years ago, there have never been more than two or three<br />
people regularly contributing to it. As is normal in open source<br />
projects people have come and gone when their interests or just the<br />
amount of time they could invest have changed.</p>
<p>At the moment Dominik Psenner and Stefan Bodewig are the only people<br />
semi-actively working on log4net and neither of them is able to devote<br />
as much time to the project as they'd like to and as would be<br />
required.</p>
<p>Realistically log4net is maintenance mode where development of new<br />
features is not going to happen.</p>
<p>This has repeatedly made log4net lag behind recent developments in the<br />
.NET world. It took a long time to get a version out that properly<br />
worked with .NET 4.0 in 2011 and adaptions to .NET 4.5 also took much<br />
longer than many users would have wished. We are seeing it again with<br />
.NET Core right now. In addition there are many unresolved issues in<br />
log4net's JIRA.</p>
<p>Despite this there are more than 2500 downloads of the logging<br />
framework every day from nuget. We are asking you, the log4net<br />
community, to get your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Right now we are in the process of creating a log4net release that<br />
works for .NET Core. It is a very targeted effort and it is very<br />
unlikely Dominik and Stefan will be able to contribute more in the<br />
future than we did during the past months.</p>
<p>If you are willing to help, please join log4net's dev mailing list and<br />
raise your hand. Look through log4net's issue tracker and pick things<br />
you'd like to work on. If you don't know where to start, please ask,<br />
Dominik and Stefan will be there to help.</p>
<p>If there is anything holding you back from contributing, let's discuss<br />
it and get it out of the way. Nothing is carved into stone, neither<br />
what the future of log4net holds nor how we make it happen.</p>
