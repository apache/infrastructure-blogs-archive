We've put together the first of hopefully many screencasts to walk you through various aspects of using OpenEJB.  This screencast shows how you can turn the plain, non-javaee version of Eclipse into an EJB testing machine.  The tutorial walks you through installing Eclipse, adding OpenEJB to your project's classpath, and creating a simple EJB with a JUnit unit test.
