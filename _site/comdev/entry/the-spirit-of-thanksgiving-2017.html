The leading local community managers, the new generation community model changers and old hackers got together to explore how to develop a better community here in China.

Special Thanks&lt;/h3&gt; Community Partners KAIYUANSHE has positioned itself as the community of communities, and our missions are to promote open source governance, community collaboration/development, and international bridging. We walk the talks by hosting the first national event on the theme of community management and open source project contribution. 25 domestic and international communities have come together hand-in-hand to make the COSCon&#39;17 possible. Kind greetings from Jim Jagielski Jim Jagielski, one of the early founder of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), recorded a greeting videos and tweeted for the conference. and the Apache Software Foundation also tweeted! Media Partners We work with the leading IT media Geekbang Technology/InfoQ China to promote and to report, with ITDKS.com for live video broadcast/replay, with Juejin.im and Linux China on their technical community platform to promote, resulting a total of more than 200,000 participants. Our exclusive registration site Huodongxing has attracted more than 60,000 viewers. Sponsor Partners We are also very grateful to our sponsors who supported us to make the conference excel. Community ﻿ Contribution The conference is concluded, but our journey has just begun. As the conference organizer, we, KAIYUANSHE&#39;s directors of the board, were worried about whether the main themes of the conference , i.e. the journey to the successful community management and project contribution, could attract the domestic technology-oriented audience. However, the feedbacks we gathered from the conference audience have been quite encouraging. Echoing perfectly the &quot;communities over code&quot; motto advocated by the world leading communities, like ASF, our key themes &quot;China community, global contribution&quot; has been highly recognized by many guru lecturers and picky audience of this conference. This is not only the biggest encouragement to our perseverance in our missions of promoting open source governance, community collaboration and international bridging, but also allows us to continue to move forward with many partners&#39; support.

<p>How does a healthy community operate? What is the ability of the community to contribute back to the people involved? How to help enterprises benefit from open source? How to help individuals get faster growth? What is the difference between the new generation of Github and the traditional foundation model? The leading local community managers, the new generation community model changers and old hackers got together to explore how to develop a better community here in China.</p>

<h3>﻿ Contribution</h3>
<p>The conference is concluded, but our journey has just begun. As the conference organizer, we, KAIYUANSHE's directors of the board, were worried about whether the main themes of the conference , i.e. the journey to the successful community management and project contribution, could attract the domestic technology-oriented audience. However, the feedbacks we gathered from the conference audience have been quite encouraging. Echoing perfectly the "communities over code" motto advocated by the world leading communities, like ASF, our key themes "China community, global contribution" has been highly recognized by many guru lecturers and picky audience of this conference. This is not only the biggest encouragement to our perseverance in our missions of promoting open source governance, community collaboration and international bridging, but also allows us to continue to move forward with many partners' support.</p>
