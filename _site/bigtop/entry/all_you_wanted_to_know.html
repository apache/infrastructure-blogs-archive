    <p>Hadoop is taking central stage in the discussions about processing of the large amount of unstructured data.</p>
<p>With<br />
 raising the popularity of the system I found that people are really<br />
puzzled with all the multiplicity of Hadoop versions; the small, yet<br />
annoying differences introduced by different vendors; the frustration<br />
when vendors are trying to lock up their customers using readily<br />
available open source data analytic components on top of Hadoop, and on<br />
and on.</p>
<p>So, after explaining who was born from whom for the 3rd time - and I<br />
tell you, drawing neat pictures on a napkin in a coffee shop isn't my<br />
favorite activity - I put together this little diagram below. Click on<br />
it to inspect it in greater details. A warning: the diagram only<br />
includes more or less significant releases of Hadoop and Hadoop-derived<br />
systems available today. I don't want to waste any time on some obscure<br />
releases or branches which never been accepted at any significant level.<br />
 The only exception is 0.21 which was a natural continuation of 0.20 and<br />
 predecessor of recently released 0.22. </p>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pHJR7XSCTlM/TzS-3-oGS4I/AAAAAAAAAB4/9M7OUrDapro/s640/hadoop-vers.png" /></p>
<p>Some explanations for the diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green rectangles designate official Apache Hadoop releases openly available for anyone in the world for free</li>
<li>Black ovals show Hadoop branches that are not yet officially<br />
released by Apache Hadoop (or might not be released ever). However, they<br />
 are usually available in the form of source code or tar-ball artifacts</li>
<li>Red ovals are for commercial Hadoop derivatives which might be based<br />
 on Hadoop or use Hadoop as a part of custom systems (like in case of<br />
MapR). These derivatives can be or can be not compatible with Hadoop and<br />
 Hadoop data processing stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you're presented with the view like this it is getting<br />
clear that there are two centers of the gravity in today's universe of<br />
elephants: 0.20.2 based releases and derivatives; and 0.22 based<br />
branches, future releases, and derivatives. Also, it becomes quite clear<br />
 which are likely to be sucked into a black hole.</p>
<p>The<br />
transition from 0.20+ to 0.2[1,2] was real critical because of<br />
introduced true HDFS append, fault injection, and code injection for<br />
system testing. And the fact that 0.21 hasn't been released for a long<br />
time, creating an empty space in the high demand environment. Even after<br />
 it did come out, it didn't get any traction in the community.<br />
Meanwhile, HDFS append was very critical for HBase to move forward, so<br />
0.20.2-append has been created to support the effort. A quite similar<br />
story had happened to 0.22: two different release managers was trying to<br />
 get it out: first gave up, but the second has actually succeeded in<br />
pulling an effort of a part of the community towards it.</p>
<p>As<br />
 you can see, HDFS append wasn't available in an official Apache Hadoop<br />
release for some time (except for 0.21 with the earlier disclaimer).<br />
Eventually it has been merged into 0.20.205 (recently dubbed as Hadoop<br />
1.0) and that allows HBase to be nicely integrated with the official<br />
Apache Hadoop without any custom patching process.</p>
<p>The<br />
release of 0.20.203 was quite significant because it provided a heavily<br />
tested Hadoop security, developed by Yahoo! Hadoop development team<br />
(known as HortonWorks nowadays). Bits and pieces of 0.20.203 - even<br />
before the official release - were absorbed by at least one commercial<br />
vendor to add corporate grade Kerberos security to their derivatives of<br />
Hadoop (as in case of Cloudera CDH3).</p>
<p>The diagram above clearly shows a few important gaps of the rest of commercial offerings:</p>
<ol>
<li>none of them supports Kerberos security (EMC, IBM, and MapR)</li>
<li>unavailability of Hbase due to the lack of HDFS append in their<br />
systems (EMC, IBM). In case of MapR you end up using a custom HBase<br />
distributed by MapR. I don't want to make any speculation of the latter<br />
in this article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently, the vacuum of significant releases between 0.20 and<br />
0.22 appeared to be a major urge for Hadoop PMC and now - just days<br />
after release of 1.0 - 0.22 got out. With 0.23 already going through<br />
release process, championed by HortonWorks team. That release brings in<br />
some interesting innovations like Federations and MapReduce 2.0.</p>
<p>Once<br />
current alpha 0.23 (which might become Hadoop 2.0 or even Hadoop 3.0) is ready for<br />
the final release I would expect new versions of commercial<br />
distributions springing to live as it was the case before. At this point<br />
 I will update the diagram :)</p>
<p>If you can imagine the<br />
variety of the other animals such as Pig, and Hive piling on top of<br />
Hadoop, you would get astonished by the complexity of inter-component<br />
relations and, more importantly, about intricacies of building a stable<br />
data processing stack. This is why project BigTop has<br />
been so important and popular ever since it sprung to life last year.<br />
