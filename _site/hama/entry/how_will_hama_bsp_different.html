<meta name="description" content="Firstly, why did we use HBase? Until last year, we tried to implement the distributed matrix/graph computing algorithms based on Map/Reduce. As you know, the Hadoop is consists of HDFS, which is designed for commodity servers as a shared nothing model (also termed as data partitioning model), and a distributed programming model called Map/Reduce. The Map/Reduce is a high-performance parallel data processing engine, to be sure, but it&#39;s not good for complex numerical/relational processing requires huge iterations or inter-node communications. So, we used HBase as a shared storage (shared memory model). Why BSP instead of Map/Reduce and HBase? However, there were still problems as below: OS overhead of running shared storage software (HBase) The limitation of HBase faculty (especially, a size of column qualifier) Growth of code complexity Therefore, we started to consider about message-passing model, and decided to adopt the BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) model, inspired by Pregel from Google Research Blog.

Yoon, June 14, 2010 According to my understanding, Pregel is graph-specific: a large-scale graph computing framework, based on BSP model. How will Hama BSP different from Pregel? Hama BSP is a computing engine, based on BSP model, like a Pregel, and it&#39;ll be compatible with existing HDFS cluster, or any FileSystem and Database in the future. However, we believe that the BSP computing model is not limited to a problems of graph; it can be used for widely distributed software such as Map/Reduce. In addition to a field of graph, there are many other algorithms, which have similar problems with graph processing using Map/Reduce. Actually, the BSP model has been researched for many years in the field of matrix computation, too. Therefore, we&#39;re trying to implement more generalized BSP computing solution. And, the Hama will consists of the BSP computing engine, and a set of few examples (e.g., matrix inversion, pagerank, BFS, ..., etc). Learn about Hama by reading the documentation." />
