Dear community,
</p><p>

The Apache Groovy team is pleased to announce version 2.5.1 of Apache Groovy.
Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the JVM.
Further details can be found at the <a href="http://groovy.apache.org/">http://groovy.apache.org</a> website.
</p><p>

For this release we focused on fixing up some of the usability/packaging issues
that the 2.5.0 release introduced as part of supporting Groovy across
JDKs 7 through (soon) 11. Maven/Gradle users not needing JAXB should
now have a much improved experience building with the new version.
(SUREFIRE users should read the release notes about some caveats).
In 2.5.2, we should have additional changes to improve the build
experience even further
for JAXB users and users of the Groovy command-line tools. Please read
the release
notes for further information:

</p><p>

This release is a maintenance release of the GROOVY_2_5_X branch.
It is strongly encouraged that all users using prior
versions on this branch upgrade to this version.
</p><p>

This release includes 44 bug fixes/improvements as outlined in the changelog:
