<h2>Command Line Interface Tool Simplifies Apache CloudStack Configuration and Management</h2>
<p></em></p>
<p>28 August 2014 &mdash;Apache CloudStack, the mature, turnkey Open Source cloud computing software platform used for creating private, public, and hybrid cloud environments, today announced Apache<br />
CloudMonkey v5.2.0, the latest feature release of its command line interface tool.</p>
<p>CloudMonkey is written in Python, and can be used both as an interactive shell and as a command line tool that simplifies CloudStack configuration and management.</p>
<p>Apache CloudMonkey v5.2.0 is the latest feature release of the 5.x line that was first released in September 2013. Some of the new features and changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple server profiles where users can use CloudMonkey against different CloudStack management servers and switch between them using a profile option;</li>
<li>A default profile under the section [local] is added with default values;</li>
<li>Some bugfixes related to network requests, error handling, JSON decoding and shell interactivity;</li>
<li>Every time 'set' is called, CloudMonkey will write the config and reload config file;</li>
<li>Configuration options 'protocol', 'host', 'port', 'path' are deprecated now but setting them is still allowed which sets a single "url" option, in the config file the [server] section is deprecated now and CloudMonkey won&rsquo;t read values from this section anymore but instead read from current server profile;</li>
<li>Missing key/values are automatically set with defaults by CloudMonkey;</li>
<li>During installation and upgrades, it will detect the platform to install either pyreadline (Windows) or readline (OSX and Linux);</li>
</ul>
