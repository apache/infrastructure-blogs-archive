  content: "I was wondering what exactly is included in these CDs or USBs? What I
    was specifically wondering is I did not see any explicit requirement to include
    the license and code. \r\n\r\nWhile many of these users want to use OpenOffice,
    I would like to see the standards include making the license available or code
    available also, even if it is a link to a website for download. \r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would like to have the source included on the CD. I see the src is 317 MB so
    that may be an issue. However, the Win version is 137 MB and that should fit on
    a CD or USB. \r\n\r\nI was just wondering if this has been presented and think
    it would be great to include the source and license. This would be useful. \r\n"

  content: "I think you can ask 3rd party distributors to comply, but there are plenty
    out there already selling it, with who-knows-what riding along on the CD.  \r\n\r\nIf
    you maintain a small list of trusted sources (that are spot-checked periodically
    for quality and continuance), it can't hurt.  People who aren't tech-savvy may
    still buy from the first listing they see on Amazon or eBay, though, which dilutes
    the impression of quality, despite your efforts."

  content: "If the list is of approved or recommended CD distributors - than yes.\r\nThis
    means ASF is auditing the distributors for compliance with GDP (good distribution
    practice).\r\nOtherwise - no.\r\n\r\nAbout the list:\r\n1) Latest isn't always
    the greatest - allow older versions.\r\n3) Add spyware and backdoors...\r\n+ Don't
    bundle or mention other software in the packaging.\r\n+ Give preference to environmentally
    friendly distributors."

  content: How would you "vet" 3rd party outlets?  And once vetted, how would you
    keep them clean for the long term (other than banning them from the list)?

  content: "With great difficulty I installed OO on Mint 14 KDE. I still don't have
    a proper icon for writer, which is what I installed it for. (I don't have the
    other apps on the desktop.) No other software package is so clumsy to install
    as yours. Some\r\ntime ago I had similar problems installing on an rpm system,
    but at least I got the icons on\r\nscreen. You really need to repackage this in
    a user-friendly way."

  content: 'I don''t mind for 3rd party CD Distributor, but I don''t think those outlet
    will last longer for "selling" OSS, you know there is not a lot of profit in there...
    since a lot of my friend would rather copy it for free from another guy who just
    downloaded the newest version... '

  content: "I say yes, put a few CD Distributors up...it will help those who just
    aren't very computer literate about downloading things to be a little 'safer'.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also like to offer a distributor to use, since I've used them a couple times over
    the years and they are friendly and service is quick and they are very inexpensive
    and they've been a CD Distributor for Distrowatch.com seems like forever, heh...\r\n\r\nOS

<p>Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) is the leading free and open office productivity suite.&nbsp; We have many millions of users.&nbsp; In the past two years we've seen over 80 million downloads from our website, and millions more from 3rd party websites.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Although most users are able to download OpenOffice successfully, we do get occasional requests for a CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something that we (the Apache Software Foundation) do not currently do.&nbsp; We make the OpenOffice source code, and installable versions of OpenOffice, available for free download.&nbsp; But we're not involved in distributing CDs.&nbsp; However, the Apache License 2.0, like most open source licenses, allows 3rd parties to copy and distribute copies of the software and even to charge for the copies.</p>
<p>So the open question is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Would it be beneficial for the Apache OpenOffice project to maintain, as a public service, a list of 3rd party CD distributors, on our website?</b> </p>
<p>Also, it is probably reasonable to ask CD distributors, in return for giving<br />
them a listing on our website, to adhere to defined best practices.&nbsp;<br />
An example <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/distribution/best-practices.html">draft Distributor Best Practices</a> page is on our website.&nbsp; <b>Is there anything that should be added or removed from that list?</b></p>
<p>We invite public comments on this topic, as comments to this blog post, or in an email to our public <a href="mailto:marketing@openoffice.apache.org">marketing mailing list</a>.&nbsp; Comments are welcome from anyone, especially users, potential distributors and the wider Apache community.&nbsp; <b>Please submit comments by January 15th for our consideration.</b></p>
<p></p>
