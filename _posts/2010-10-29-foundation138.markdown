Recent reports on various blogs have attributed to the ASF a number of
the source files identified by Oracle as ones that they believe
infringe on their copyrights.  The code in question has an header that
mentions Apache, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  The
code itself is using a license that is named after our foundation, is
in fact the license that we ourselves use.  Many others use it too, as
the license was explicitly designed to allow such uses.

Even though the code in question has an Apache license, it is not part of
Harmony. PolicyNodeImpl.java is simply not a Harmony class.

</p>
  <p>Verifying that something is from the Apache Software Foundation is
very easy to do: our sources are all posted online. So it is
sad when people don't take that step.</p>
