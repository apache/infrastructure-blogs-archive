In short, Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 is a full IDE for Java SE development.</b></p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: Apache NetBeans is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache<br />
Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.<br />
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further<br />
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision<br />
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other<br />
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a<br />
reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does<br />
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</i></p>
