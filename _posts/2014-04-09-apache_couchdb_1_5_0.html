<p>Apache CouchDB 1.5.0 has been released and is available for download.</p>
<p>CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, via HTTP. Query, combine, and transform your documents with JavaScript. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can even serve web apps directly out of CouchDB. And you can distribute your data, or your apps, efficiently using CouchDB&rsquo;s incremental replication. CouchDB supports master-master setups with automatic conflict detection.</p>
