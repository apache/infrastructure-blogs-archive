<div role="main" class="undoreset clearfix" id="message1898410106" style="overflow: visible; visibility: visible;">The
Apache Software Foundation has become a worldwide force in the software
industry because of the diverse programs, applications,and tools built
on its projects such as the HTTP Server, Tomcat, Hadoop, Lucene and
many others. This year, we’re celebrating 10 years of the ASF!<br /><div class="plainMail"><p>While
the Foundation and committers have kept the innovation coming, it's the
millions of users who have helped make Apache one of the most pervasive
Open Source communities in the world. So, in celebrating the success of
Apache, we’re celebrating you. <br /><br />To recognize the breadth of the
Apache footprint, we're inviting all Apache users to submit a video
telling everyone why you love Apache.&nbsp; Maybe you've created a cool
program, Website or device. Maybe you use Apache at work and it makes
your life a bit easier. Or perhaps you just love hacking on Apache
software. We want to hear all about it! <br /><br /><b>WHO SHOULD SUBMIT?<br /></b><br />MyApache
community video submissions are open for any individual or group who
has used or is using Apache code from any Apache project an in
interesting way.<br /><br />There is no limit to the number of videos an
individual or group can submit, but each video must cover a different
Apache use or implementation.<br /><br /><b>WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN YOUR VIDEO SALUTE<br /></b><br />Each
MyApache video submission should be no longer than 1 minute in length.
While we encourage you to get creative and play up the humor, any
videos containing inappropriate, distasteful or illegal content will be
disqualified and prohibited from being posted.<br /><br />MyApache video content should tell the story of who you are as an Apache user and how you have used Apache. <br /><br />Video content should describe:<br /><br />1. Things you have created or accomplished with Apache<br />2. Why you love Apache<br />3. Your thoughts and happy anniversary wishes to the Apache Software Foundation (singing “Happy Birthday” is encouraged!)<br /><br />Your video content can answer a combination of these questions:<br /><br />Q. Why do I like Apache?<br />Q. Why did I start using Apache? <br />Q. How long have I used Apache?<br />Q. How often do I use Apache?<br />Q. How do I use Apache?<br />Q. Do I use Apache at work, for hobby or other times? <br />Q. What Apache project(s) do I currently work with or have worked with in the past? <br />Q. What was particularly good about those projects or their communities?<br />Q. What and where are some of the improvements I’ve seen in Apache since I began using it?<br />Q. How does Apache differ from other Open Source communities?<br />Q. What is my happy anniversary wish to Apache?<br />Q. Why would I like to thank Apache?<br /><br /><b>HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR &quot;MYAPACHE&quot; VIDEO<br /></b><br />To
submit your video, go to www.YouSendIt.com and use the &quot;Try Sending
