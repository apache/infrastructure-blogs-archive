<p>Hi All,</p>
<p> <a href="https://blogs.apache.org" title="blogs.apache.org main site">blogs.apache.org</a> &nbsp; - the site you are reading now! has had a bit of an update.</p></p>
<p>1. We moved it from an aged VM Host to the Cloud (thanks LeaseWeb!)</p>
<p>2. We puppetised the entire service, from install to deploy (see our <a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/tree/deployment/modules/blogs_asf" title="Github Mirror of infrastructure-puppet">Github</a> Mirror )</p>
<p>3. We upgraded the Apache Roller software from 5.0.3 to the latest 5.1.2</p>
<p>4. We enabled LDAP for logins. That's right! Every single ASF Committer can now just login! No more creating an INFRA Jira ticket just to get a Roller account on <a href="http://blogs.apache.org">blogs.apache.org</a></p>
<p> Other stuff remains the same - meaning if you are a Blog Administrator you still need to invite committers into your blog, you still need to choose to make them an Author or Admin etc - Roller doesnt support anything more than login auth for LDAP currently - but I bet the <a href="https://roller.apache.org" title="roller project website">project</a> would love to see the LDAP integration extended and improved if you feel the need!.</p>
<p>Anyhow, our first new year present to our ASF Committers, a shiny updated blog instance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Enjoy, and have a great 2017!!</p>
<p></p>
