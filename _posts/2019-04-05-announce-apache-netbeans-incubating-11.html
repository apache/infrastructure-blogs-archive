  content: "Very cool. Looking forward to the upgrade. Looks cleaner. \r\n\r\nIs there
    any intent to go back in the direction of a JavaScript IDE after the integration
    with Apache is complete? \r\n\r\nIn the 2013-2014 timeline I used NetBeans to
    build a complex server and webclient using Angular 1.0. Debugging both in the
    excellent NetBeans debugger was the cat's pajamas!"

  content: No one is abandoning C/C++. It's in fact the next part of NetBeans that
    will be donated by Oracle to Apache, sometime during this year, probably around
    September, and then it will be integrated into Apache NetBeans, too.
