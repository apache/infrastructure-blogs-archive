<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> is a project within the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#what">Apache Software Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization. &nbsp;We don't charge for Apache OpenOffice; we make it available to all for free. &nbsp; We don't pay developers; we rely on <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Directory+of+Volunteers">volunteers</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>People need office productivity software.&nbsp; Among our users are students, teachers, doctors, lawyers, ministers, public servants, and business people from all industries.&nbsp; Perhaps 20 years ago it was only businesses that needed this kind of software.&nbsp; In 1992 the price of a spreadsheet application alone, not even a complete suite, was $595.&nbsp; Only business could afford it at that price. &nbsp; But today almost everyone with a computer needs a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.html">word processor</a>, a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">spreadsheet</a> and/or a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html">presentation editor</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office productivity applications are used in the home, at school and in the office.</p>
<p>Users have downloaded Apache OpenOffice from <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/countries.html">236 countries and territories</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The above chart shows the download density of Apache OpenOffice 3.4 per country, normalized by the number of internet users in each country (based using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users">ITU data</a>).&nbsp; If you click on the<br />
chart you can explore it interactively using IBM's Many Eyes service<br />
(Java required). </p>
<p>The reach of Apache OpenOffice is global and deep.&nbsp; Our 3.4. release has been downloaded <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/downloads.html">over 37 million times</a> since May 2012.</p></p>
<p>Although Apache OpenOffice is free, it still has value, and the value we produce can be estimated.</p>
<p>The main alternative to OpenOffice is Microsoft Office, perhaps the lower-priced "Home and Student" edition. &nbsp;The latest version (2013) is sold by Microsoft on their website for a variety of prices, varying by country.&nbsp; In the U.S. it is $139.99.&nbsp; In Germany it is quoted at 139,00 &euro;, which is $188.04 USD.&nbsp; In Australia it is $169.00 AUD which is $174.42 USD.&nbsp; In Russia it is 3499.00 Rubles, which is $116.30 USD.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's take, for ease of calculation, an intermediate value of $150.00 USD for Microsoft Office 2013 Home and Student.&nbsp; A person who uses the free OpenOffice saves $150 over paying for Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 has averaged 138,928 downloads per day.&nbsp; That is an average value to the public of $21 million per day. &nbsp;Or $7.61 billion (7.61 thousand million) per year.&nbsp; This is one estimate of the value we bring to the public.</p>
<p>
To put that in perspective, here are annual sales figures for some familiar companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campbell Soup Company: $7.88 Billion</li>
<li>Royal Caribbean Cruises: $7.66 Billion</li>
<li>Mastercard Inc.: $7.39 Billion</li>
<li>InfoSys: $7.23 Billion</li>
<li>Barnes &amp; Noble: $7.16 Billion</li>
<li>OfficeMax Inc.: $7.06 Billion</li>
</ul>
<p>We should be proud of what we've accomplished over the past decade.&nbsp; This is not only a success for Apache OpenOffice in our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mission.html">Public Service Mission</a>, but a demonstration of the reach and impact of open source software in general.</p>
