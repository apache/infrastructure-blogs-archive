<p>This week, we are excited to launch the 2022 ASF Community Survey, which will gather scientific data that allows us to understand our community better, both in its demographic composition and collaboration styles and preferences. We want to find areas where we can continue to do great work and others where we need to provide more support so that our projects can keep growing healthy and diverse. This joint effort was long overdue: our last surveys of this kind were implemented in 2016 [1] and 2020 [2], which means we are finally in a position to see trends over time.</p>
<p>For this new version of the survey, we worked with Bitergia to design it. Bitergia is an expert in analyzing open source communities and other types of software development teams. They have deep experience running this type of survey and research in open source communities. Among other studies, their previous work includes an analysis in gender diversity in technical contributions for OpenStack [3]. The 2022 ASF Community Survey is the first part of a two-stage research project. The second part consists of interviews with people who have contributed to the ASF in order to assess their experience. We’ll share more on this second part of the project soon.</p>
<p>This survey and research are part of the ASF’s efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive and diverse community. They are run by the Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion, a team formed last May. We’ll share a broader update about this group in January.</p>
<p>If you have an <a href="http://apache.org/">apache.org</a> email address, you will receive an email by August 1st at noon PST with a link to the survey. Please take 15 minutes to complete it. If you didn’t receive the email or you do not have an <a href="http://apache.org/">apache.org</a> email address, please use this link to complete the survey:&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are looking to hear from everyone in our community: from users and contributors, to committers and PMCs–everyone’s voice matters.&nbsp;</p>
