If you are a reader of the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/mail-lists.html">Log4PHP developers list</a>, you probably know it already: We (especially Gavin) managed to get it to build Log4PHP on a regular basis via Apaches Buildbot. Click <a href="http://ci.apache.org/projects/log4php">here</a> to see the latest available website. 

The most cool feature is that Gavin managed it to install XDebug on the server. This way we can have regular code coverage reports. With that little piece of software I think we have now a working and quite complete enviroment for future development.
