<p>The Apache Software Foundation is <a href="http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">participating</a> in GSoC again this<br />
year, and CouchDB is on the project list of course!</p>
<p>By the end of the summer, we hope you've above all, had fun, and we've<br />
enabled you to make a valued contribution, and ideally help you<br />
continue in your involvement with the CouchDB project.</p>
<h4>I'm a student, how do I start?</h4>

<h4>I'm interested in being a mentor for the CouchDB project!</h4>
<p>Thanks! Please read up on being a <a href="http://community.apache.org/guide-to-being-a-mentor.html">mentor</a> and contact<br />
