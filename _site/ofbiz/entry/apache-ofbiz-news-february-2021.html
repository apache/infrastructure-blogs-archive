<meta name="description" content="&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Apache OFBiz News February 2021 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about JCenter shutdown, Java Open JDK 11 &amp; 17 support, and Customer journey with an E-commerce discussion series along with our usual list of features, improvements, and Statistics. JFrog to shut down JCenter Apache OFBiz uses Bintray JCenter as a Gradle repository to download and consume dependencies. Recently, JFrog announced to shut down JCenter services on May 1st, 2021. Users of these services will need to migrate to the respective canonical repository.During this month, the community discussed how we can handle it in the most feasible way where we concluded &amp; worked upon successful migration to Maven Central. The community also decided to have another release for the 17.12 series to support existing users. If you are using any release post 16.11 with the Gradle build system in place, we recommend you to upgrade with the latest upcoming release 17.12.06.Here is the link to the official announcement:https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/Here are the quick links to the discussion and efforts:https://s.apache.org/5pc08https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12171Thanks Taher Alkhateeb, Michael Brohl, Jacques Le Roux and Nicolas Malin for the valuable discussion and efforts put in this direction. Java Open JDK 11 and 17 Support During this month, the community discussed upon the support for JDK 11 and 17 for upcoming branches. JDK11 will be available at least until October 2024 and JDK17 (LTS) will be available from September 2021 until 2025 (considering a minimum of 4 years support for LTS). The community decided to go with JDK11 for upcoming release branch r21 and move forward to JDK17 for trunk when available. JDK11 is already mature and the community already made OFBiz ready for it. Refer to the below link to track efforts related to JDK11 support:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757Here is the quick link to the discussion:https://s.apache.org/3ykitThanks Michael Brohl for initiating the discussion and to everyone who gave their valuable inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer journey with an E-commerce The OFBiz community is discussing &quot;Customer journey with an E-commerce&quot; where the community will be covering the following aspects: - The expectations of a customer while buying from an e-commerce v/s the expectation of a customer while buying from a brick and mortar store - Improving customer experience while buying from an e-commerce - Order life cycle and communicating with the customer during various order life cycle events- Role of mobile-first, omnichannel, buy online and pick up in-store (BOPIS), buy online and return in-store (BORIS) strategies in improving customer experience The community had the initial discussion where the following points were discussed: - Purpose of the series - Understand the expectation of the customer while buying online - Ways to improve the customer experience - Action plan for the discussion - Order life cycle and communication - Online and offline sales channels - Customer retention and acquisition Here is the link to the initial discussion:https://youtu.be/prYuGbUJPPIIf you want to be part of this discussion and share your experiences, join the conversationhttps://s.apache.org/u2ewaThanks Arpit Mor for initiating it and to everyone who contributed to it. &lt;/p&gt;

<h2>Apache OFBiz News February 2021</h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we<br />
have news about JCenter shutdown, Java Open JDK 11 &amp; 17 support, and<br />
 Customer journey with an E-commerce discussion series along with our<br />
usual list of features, improvements, and Statistics.</p>
<h3>JFrog to shut down JCenter</h3>
<p>  Apache OFBiz uses <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sub:maven_jcenter" target="_blank">Bintray JCenter</a> as a Gradle repository to download and consume dependencies. Recently,<br />
JFrog announced to shut down JCenter services on May 1st, 2021. Users of these services will need to migrate to the respective canonical repository.<br>During this month, the community discussed how we can handle it in the most feasible way where we concluded &amp; worked upon successful migration to Maven Central. The community also decided to have another release for the 17.12 series to support existing users. <br>If you are using any release post 16.11 with the Gradle build system in place, we recommend you to upgrade with the latest upcoming release 17.12.06.<br><br>Here is the link to the official announcement:<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/" target="_blank">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a><br><br>Here are the quick links to the discussion and efforts:<br><a href="https://s.apache.org/5pc08">https://s.apache.org/5pc08</a><br><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12171" target="_blank">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12171</a><br><br>Thanks<br />
 Taher Alkhateeb, Michael Brohl, Jacques Le Roux and Nicolas Malin for<br />
the valuable discussion and efforts put in this direction.</p>
<h3>Java Open JDK 11 and 17 Support<br></h3>
<p>During this month, the community discussed upon the support for JDK 11 and 17 for upcoming branches. JDK11 will be available at least until October 2024 and JDK17<br />
(LTS) will be available from September 2021 until 2025 (considering a minimum of 4 years support for LTS). The community decided to go with JDK11<br />
 for upcoming release branch r21 and move forward to JDK17 for trunk when available. JDK11 is already mature and the community already made<br />
OFBiz ready for it. <br><br>Refer to the below link to track efforts related to JDK11 support:<br><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757" target="_blank">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757</a><br><br>Here is the quick link to the discussion:<br><a href="https://s.apache.org/3ykit" target="_blank">https://s.apache.org/3ykit</a><br><br>Thanks Michael Brohl for initiating the discussion and to everyone who gave their valuable inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
