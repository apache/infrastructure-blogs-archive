  <div>&quot;We are pleased to add JetBrains to our roster of Targeted Sponsors,&quot; said Daniel Ruggeri, ASF Vice President Fundraising. &quot;As there are many ways to contribute to Open Source Software and the communities that support it, we are immensely grateful for our Sponsors' support by means of targeted donations in addition to monetary contributions.&quot;</div>
