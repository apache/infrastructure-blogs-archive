<p>This is a general call-to-arms for everyone who uses log4net as their
logging solution. If log4net is the logging framework that you are
using and would like to keep using in the future it is time now to get
involved. The project needs a larger developing community to move on!
We really need more people who want to shape the future of log4net at
the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<p>In all the time since log4net has been started by Nicko Cadell more
than ten years ago, there have never been more than two or three
people regularly contributing to it. As is normal in open source
projects people have come and gone when their interests or just the
amount of time they could invest have changed.</p>

<p>At the moment Dominik Psenner and Stefan Bodewig are the only people
semi-actively working on log4net and neither of them is able to devote
as much time to the project as they'd like to and as would be
required.</p>

<p>Realistically log4net is maintenance mode where development of new
features is not going to happen.</p>

<p>This has repeatedly made log4net lag behind recent developments in the
.NET world. It took a long time to get a version out that properly
worked with .NET 4.0 in 2011 and adaptions to .NET 4.5 also took much
longer than many users would have wished. We are seeing it again with
.NET Core right now. In addition there are many unresolved issues in
log4net's JIRA.</p>

<p>Despite this there are more than 2500 downloads of the logging
framework every day from nuget. We are asking you, the log4net
community, to get your hands dirty.</p>

<p>Right now we are in the process of creating a log4net release that
works for .NET Core. It is a very targeted effort and it is very
unlikely Dominik and Stefan will be able to contribute more in the
future than we did during the past months.</p>

<p>If you are willing to help, please join log4net's dev mailing list and
raise your hand. Look through log4net's issue tracker and pick things
you'd like to work on. If you don't know where to start, please ask,
Dominik and Stefan will be there to help.</p>

<p>If there is anything holding you back from contributing, let's discuss
it and get it out of the way. Nothing is carved into stone, neither
what the future of log4net holds nor how we make it happen.</p>
