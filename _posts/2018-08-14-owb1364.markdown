The Apache OpenWebBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache Meecrowave 1.2.3<br /><br />Apache Meecrowave is a small server (only 9MB) fully based on Apache Tomcat9 and other JavaEE 8 technologies<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache Tomcat-9.0.10 (Servlets-4.0)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache OpenWebBeans-2.0.6 (CDI-2.0)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache Johnzon-1.1.8 (JSON-P-1.1 and JSON-B-1.0), and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache CXF-3.2.5 (JAX-RS-2.1).<br /><br />That means it is ideally suited for Microservices and standalone applications.<br /><br />Meecrowave
 can be either started via a maven plugin (for ease of development), 
programmatically as embedded server, bundled as application with your 
business code or as runner to start up portable WAR or JAR applications.<br /><br />The source distribution package can be downloaded from our mirrors:<br />https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/openwebbeans/meecrowave/1.2.3<br /><br />Hashes can be found here<br />https://www.apache.org/dist/openwebbeans/meecrowave/1.2.3</p>
