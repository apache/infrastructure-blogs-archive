<p>
    Hi all. Today, we will show you about <a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan">PHPStan</a> integration which will be available in the <b>next NetBeans version</b> i.e. <b>NetBeans 10</b> as a new code analysis feature.<br />
    If you have already used other code analysis features(e.g. Code Sniffer), you should be able to use this with similar way soon.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>
    First of all, let's set the Options (Tools > Options > PHP > Code Analysis > PHPStan). You can set a script path, a configuration file path and a level.<br />
    At least you have to set the PHPStan script path to "PHPStan". If you don't set "Configuration" path, the configuration file of project root directory would be used.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/fb6ddce7-8803-4cc5-a193-f53b4b8f0658"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/fb6ddce7-8803-4cc5-a193-f53b4b8f0658" alt="Nb10-php-phpstan-support-options.png"></img></a></p>
<h3>Inspect project/directory/file</h3>
<p>
    Then, let's inspect a project/direcoty/file using PHPStan. Please click "Source > Inspect...".<br />
    The inspect dialog is shown.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/8f1dbf55-e46e-4425-bac5-00df2dd7cf80"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/8f1dbf55-e46e-4425-bac5-00df2dd7cf80" alt="Nb10-php-phpstan-support-inspect-dialog.png"></img></a></p>
<p>
    Please choose "Scope" which you would like to inspect and PHPStan as "Configuration".<br />
    The files are inspected when you click the "inspect" button.<br />
    Finally, The results are shown in the inspector window after the inspection is done.</p>
