<div><em><strong>Open Source distributed messaging and streaming Big Data platform in use at Alibaba Group, Didi Chuxing, S.F. Express, WeBank, Peking University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences, among others.</strong></em></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;25 September 2017&ndash;</strong> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; RocketMQ&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>Apache RocketMQ is an Open Source distributed messaging and streaming Big Data platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and flexible scalability.</p>
<p>"I am very excited to see Apache RocketMQ as a Top-Level Project and I would like to thank our mentors for all their help, the Apache Incubator Project Management Committee for its advice and guidance, everyone in the RocketMQ community, and Alibaba for publishing the research upon which RocketMQ is based," said Xiaorui Wang, Vice President of Apache RocketMQ. "During the incubation process, the RocketMQ community worked very hard to develop high-quality distributed software for messaging and streaming, in an open and inclusive manner in accordance with the Apache Way."</p>
</p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>RocketMQ originated at Alibaba in 2012, and, after handling 1.2 trillion concurrent online message transmissions in the Alibaba Nov. 11th Global Shopping Festival, was donated to the Apache Incubator in November 2016. Apache RocketMQ v4.0.0 was released in February 2017.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a distributed messaging engine, RocketMQ features include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Low latency; more than 99.6% response latency within 1 millisecond under high pressure;</li>
<li>Finance-oriented, high availability with tracking and auditing features;</li>
<li>Industry-sustainable, trillion-level message capacity guaranteed;</li>
<li>Vendor-neutral, support multiple messaging protocols like JMS and OpenMessaging;</li>
<li>Big Data friendly, batch transferring with versatile integration for flooding throughput; and</li>
<li>Massive accumulation, given sufficient disk space, accumulate messages without performance loss.
</li>
</ul></div>
<div>"RocketMQ was conceived from the outset as an open-source distributed messaging and streaming platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and flexible scalability," said Von Gosling, original co-creator of RocketMQ and Chief Architect of Aliware MQ at Alibaba Group. "It has been great to witness the growth of the RocketMQ community and codebase as an ASF incubating project, and I look forward to this continuing as a Top-Level Project. Today, more than 100 companies are using Apache RocketMQ, with more feedback coming from the community. According to our data, more than 80% of the project's contributions are from outside the donator Alibaba Group."</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to Alibaba Group, Apache RocketMQ is in use at hundreds of companies and research/educational institutions that include Didi Chuxing, S.F. Express, WeBank, Peking University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences, among others.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Graduation from the Incubator marks an important milestone for the RocketMQ project," said Bruce Snyder, Apache RocketMQ Incubator Mentor and Director of Software Development at SAP Hybris. "This is recognition of the focus and hard work of the project members to learn The Apache Way and drive community around RocketMQ. I am honored to have helped guide the project to a successful graduation."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"At Didi, we have used Apache RocketMQ as storage engine to build MessageQueue service. Based on high availability and high performance of RocketMQ we provide high-quality service," said Neil Qi, Architect at Didi Chuxing. "I believe RocketMQ will become the best MessageQueue project in future."</div>
<div>
<p>"New participants are more than welcome to join the project, To serve the community better, we created and maintained two repositories, one as our kernel version and the other one is for community contributions. The community contributed some integrated projects with some other Apache TLPs like Apache Storm, Apache Ignite, Apache Spark and Apache Flume," said Xinyu "yukon" Zhou, member of the Apache RocketMQ Project Management Committee. "We enthusiastically look forward to working together with all contributors to Apache RocketMQ in order to advance the state-of-the-art distributed messaging engine."</p>
<p><strong>Availability and Oversight<br /></strong>Apache RocketMQ software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

<div><strong>About the Apache Incubator</strong></div>
<div>The Apache Incubator is the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
