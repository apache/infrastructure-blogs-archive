<p>Today, ASF Infra launched new features for projects wishing to update their notification schemes for git/github activity on their own.</p><p>Via the <a href="https://s.apache.org/asfyaml" target="_blank">.asf.yaml</a> file, projects can now define notification schemes for their repositories, including targets for commit emails, github events, as well as JIRA notification options.</p><p>To utilize this feature, please see the <a href="https://s.apache.org/asfyaml-notify" target="_blank">notification scheme documentation</a>.</p><p>Along with this notification scheme feature, we have also launched some corrective measures for repositories where github activity did not result in proper relaying to our mailing lists, so some projects may start seeing event messages that did not appear before. Furthermore, we are now combining review comments into single emails, to lessen the load in your inbox.</p><p><br></p><p>With regards,</p><p>The ASF Infrastructure Team.<br></p>
