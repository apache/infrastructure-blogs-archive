  <p>I became active in The Apache Software Foundation at its inception in 1999. I am responsible for elevating the ASF's visibility, and supporting the Foundation by counseling 350+ Apache projects and their communities in the areas of messaging, outreach, and engagement.</p> 
  <p>As a global, virtual, and diverse community, the ASF relies on countless Apache Members, Committers, and Contributors to help share our values and explain our processes with others. We have grown from a single project to hundreds of projects and communities <a href="https://projects.apache.org/committees.html?date">https://projects.apache.org/committees.html?date</a> through &quot;The Apache Way&quot;: an inclusive process and judicious reinforcement of &quot;Community Over Code&quot;.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>We launched the &quot;Success at Apache&quot; blog series following the Media &amp; Analyst Training at ApacheCon Seville in 2016. I asked ASF Board Member and VP Brand Management Mark Thomas his opinion on what he thinks are some of the reasons that the ASF &quot;just works&quot;. His immediate response was: &quot;project independence&quot;. I asked if he'd put that in writing —in his own words— as our community members' personal experiences help others see The Apache Way through their unique perspectives. Shortly afterwards, we published &quot;Project Independence&quot; <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success_at_apache_project_independence">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success_at_apache_project_independence</a>&nbsp;and &quot;Success at Apache&quot; was born <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/feed/entries/atom?cat=SuccessAtApache">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/feed/entries/atom?cat=SuccessAtApache</a> .&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Whilst English is the ASF's official language, localization often helps foster understanding,&nbsp; encourage adoption, and onboard new contributors more quickly. A while back, ASF Member Ted Liu told me that he and some of his coworkers had translated a handful of our &quot;Success at Apache&quot; blog posts into Mandarin Chinese. He asked if it would be useful to us.</p> 
  <p>Why yes, of course: new approaches to promote and propagate The Apache Way are always appreciated.</p>

  <p>Ted's action reflects one of our greatest successes at Apache: the mindset of &quot;If this is helpful to me, that's good (= &quot;scratch your own itch&quot;). If it helps others, all the better.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>After all, we didn't become the world's largest Open Source foundation by not being helpful. There's always something needing to be done in an all-volunteer community: if you'd like to help the ASF, we will happily accept your assistance where possible. Plus, helping others feels pretty great.</p>
