It’s been nearly a year since <a href="https://geode.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Geode</a> joined the Apache Incubator with a grant of more than 1.3 million lines of code of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGTYUi3dMm4" target="_blank">the commercial GemFire in-memory data grid technology</a>. Since that time, the Apache Geode project has diligently been working to ensure this code meets Apache licensing standards, while at the same time building up the nascent <a href="http://projects.bitergia.com/apache-geode/browser/" target="_blank">Apache Geode community</a>. Recently we held the first <a href="http://geodesummit.com/" target="_blank">Geode Summit in March</a> with more than 100 attendees and 22 sessions from contributors and users.

The Apache Geode technology is a distributed, in-memory data management platform that has been in used in thousands of enterprise projects over the last 15 years. Geode provides low latency data persistence, transactions, and query services to applications that need to scale-out concurrent operations with very fast response times.  The Geode technology has been used to support <a href="https://2016.event.geodesummit.com/schedule/sessions/wall_st_derivative_risk_solutions_using_geode.html" target="_blank">financial trading applications</a> for extremely large portfolios, and travel and logistics operations that <a href="https://2016.event.geodesummit.com/schedule/sessions/design_tradeoffs_in_distributed_systems_how_southwest_airlines_uses_geode.html" target="_blank">support transportation systems</a> of entire countries such as <a href="http://pivotal.io/big-data/case-study/scaling-online-sales-for-the-largest-railway-in-the-world-china-railway-corporation" target="_blank">China’s</a> and <a href="https://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/case-studies/case-study-300-increase-in-app-performance-with-india-rail-on-pivotal-gemfire" target="_blank">India’s</a> railways.

Over the past 3 months, the project delivered its first two milestone releases, clearing license requirements in its first official release and bringing to open source the majority of features used in mission-critical enterprise deployments. The Apache Geode PPMC would like to thank our mentors, the members of Apache Incubator, and our growing tribe of contributors and committers for helping us create and validate these important releases.

Details about each release are below. We now are focused on reaching a generally available Apache Geode 1.0 release. We ask the Apache community to help by <a href="http://geode.incubator.apache.org/releases/" target="_blank">trying the latest Apache Geode (incubating) release</a>, taking the software for a spin, and reporting any issues you find.
 
<h2>1.0.0-incubating.M1 – “Becoming Viable” </h2>
Read the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/1.0.0-incubating.M1+%28First%29+Release" target="_blank">detailed release information here</a>.
 
Major accomplishments included just getting a first Apache release and replacing incompatible licensed components. Most notably, this included rebasing a forked version of JGroups that led to a refactoring of the Geode’s powerful cluster-member management.
 
<h2>1.0.0-incubating.M2 – “Bringing Extreme Scale and Low Latency to Open Source”</h2>
Our latest release was approved on April 21. Read the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/1.0.0-incubating.M2+%28Second%29+Release" target="_blank">detailed release information here</a>.
 
This release incorporates some popular features from the commercial technology for supporting higher-scale deployments with low-latency requirements, and analyzing performance. These include:
·       Cluster-to-cluster WAN connectivity and replication for achieving disaster recovery, fail-over, global deployments, and servicing different application workloads on the same data.
·       Continuous queries on the cluster side that detect and respond to user-defined events, allowing clients to register these detection criteria and subscribing to event notices.  This enables low-latency responses even with a high number of concurrent clients operating with the cluster.
·       The Pulse management tool for analyzing cluster logs to diagnose and optimize cluster performance and behavior.
 
Some other goodies include the modules for implementing session-state caching in Apache Tomcat, and Hibernate L2 Cache. We also closed <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12318420&version=12334709">359 issues</a>.
