<p><strong></strong><strong></strong><b>Wakefield, DE</b> - <strong>22</strong><strong> July 2022 </strong>- Apache OpenOffice, a leading Open Source office document productivity<br />
 suite, announced today Apache OpenOffice 4.1.13, as usual available in<br />
41 languages for Windows, macOS and Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apache OpenOffice</a><br />
 4.1.13 is a Security release incorporating bug fixes and other enhancements. All<br />
users of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.12 or earlier are advised to upgrade. You<br />
can download Apache OpenOffice 4.1.13 <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Windows 10 and 11 users can now also get Apache OpenOffice for selected languages in the "Microsoft Store" App.</p>
<p>It is recommended to make a backup of the Apache OpenOffice users profile<br />
before installing AOO 4.1.13. It is especially important for users who use<br />
the Master Password functionality and may decide to use an older version<br />
later. There is a change in the encoding of stored passwords in this 4.1.13<br />
release that may make your user profile unusable for previous versions.<br />
<br><br />
<br>In general, it is always a good idea to do a backup of important and<br />
personal data, so we recommend to always backup your OpenOffice user profile<br />
before doing an upgrade to a newer release.</p>
