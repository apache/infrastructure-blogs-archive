  <div><strong>Wakefield, MA —12&nbsp;December 2018—</strong> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache® Griffin™ as a Top-Level Project (TLP).</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>Apache Griffin is a robust Open Source Big Data quality solution for distributed data systems at any scale. It provides a unified process to measure data quality from different perspectives, as well as building and validating trusted data assets in both streaming or batch contexts. Griffin originated at eBay and entered the Apache Incubator in December 2016.</div> 
  <div> 
    <p>&quot;We are very proud of Griffin reaching this important milestone,&quot; said William Guo, Vice President of Apache Griffin. &quot;By actively improving Big Data quality, Griffin helps build trusted data assets, therefore boosting your confidence in your business.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> </div> 
  <div>Apache Griffin enables data scientists/analysts to handle data quality issues by:</div> 
  <div> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Defining –specifying data quality requirements such as accuracy, completeness, timeliness, profiling, etc.;<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>Measuring –source data ingested into the Griffin computing cluster will apply data quality measurement based on user-defined requirements; and<br /><br /> </li> 
      <li>Applying Metrics –data quality reports as metrics will be exported to designated destination.<br /><br /></li> 
    </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div> </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>In addition, Griffin allows users to easily onboard new requirements into the platform and write comprehensive logic to further define their data quality.&nbsp;</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>Apache Griffin is in use in high volume, high demand environments at 163.com/Netease, eBay, Expedia, Huawei, JD.com, Meituan, PayPal, Pingan Bank, PPDAI, VIP.com, and VMWare, among others.</p>

    <p>&quot;eBay contributed Griffin to the Apache Incubator in December 2016 to ensure its future development in a community-driven manner. It started with the idea on how eBay could address the data quality issue across multiple systems, especially in streaming context,&quot; said Vivian Tian, VP of eBay, GM - China Center of Excellence. &quot;Griffin brings data quality solution to data ecosystem and ensure data applications have a solid quality foundation. We are extremely happy to see Griffin graduate as an Apache Top Level Project, and look forward to continued innovation and collaboration with the Apache community.&quot;</p> 
    <p> </p>

  <div>&quot;We have been using Apache Griffin for about two years, monitoring 1000+ tables with data quality metrics, and are very happy to see it graduate to a Top-Level Project,&quot; said Chao Zhu, Senior Director at VIPshop Finance. &quot;Apache Griffin and its data quality DSL can help us easily identify data quality issues instantly on our big data platform. In addition, Apache Griffin's architecture is highly extensible. We are looking forward to using it in real time data quality management system. We also look forward to contribute some of our minor enhancement to Griffin back to the community.&quot;</div> 
  <div> </div> 
  <p>&quot;We appreciate the Griffin project which really helps so much in our daily data jobs.After years of struggling with the complexity of data quality issues, we turned to Apache Griffin for a new platform that would simplify our data quality pipeline,&quot; said Jianfeng Liu, Director of Real-time Data Department at PPDAI. &quot;Because of Apache Griffin's unified model for both batch and stream processing, we've been able to replace legacy systems with one solution that works seamlessly in our production environment. Griffin DSLs have allowed us to dramatically simplify our pipeline and to reduce our efforts a lot. I'm very proud and excited to see that the project is graduating.&quot;</p> 
  <div>&quot;Apache Griffin is one of the best data quality solutions which my team has been used so far. It has been an exciting journey seeing the Griffin community evolve rapidly. And many people iteratively adopting it and contributing to newer capabilities,&quot; said Austin Sun, Senior Engineering Manager, Enterprise Service Platform at PayPal. &quot;In PayPal risk domain, we benefit a lot from Apache Griffin to provide high quality data to make precise decision and protect our customer. In addition to PayPal risk, I knew there are several other corporates also leverages core capability from Griffin as their data quality solution. It’s my great honor to witness Griffin grows to a top level project. Way to go, Griffin.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Apache Griffin project is yet another showcase how community over code can work for projects coming out from internal usages of companies into the open source,&quot; said Henry Saputra, ASF member and Incubator Mentor for Apache Griffin. &quot;I am proud to be the part of the projects and mentors for the project when it was being contributed from eBay, in addition to several other projects already donated to ASF such as Apache Kylin and Eagle. The team has worked tremendously hard to adapt the Apache Way, and also shown great respect for the open source community in all the processes for design, development, and release processes.As a Top-Level Project I believe the PMC will help lead the project to much more success in the future.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Graduation is not the end, it is the beginning of another journey. We hope to take Apache Griffin to the next level with a wider set of features and users,&quot; added Guo. &quot;We welcome anyone to join our efforts by helping with product design, documentation, code, technical discussions or promoting Apache Griffin in The Apache Way.&quot;</div>
