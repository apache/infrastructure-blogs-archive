<p>With ApacheCon North America 2018 now less than 2 months out, we want to draw your attention to a few highlights:</p>
<p>The full schedule is <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/schedule.html">available on the website</a>, and features talks from dozens of our projects, and from all across the technology universe. From IoT to containers to cloud to desktop to personal finance, Apache remains in the forefront of technology innovation.</p>
<p>We're beginning to put together our <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/bof.html">BOF (Birds of a Feather) schedule</a>. If your project or community wants to plan an after-hours gathering, we provide the space and you provide the content. We have 4 rooms on 3 evenings. <a href="mailto:help@apachecon.com">Get in touch with the ApacheCon Planners</a> with your BoF title, description, and preferred date/time to get on the schedule.</p>
<p>As usual, we're planning a BarCamp (all day Monday), a keysigning, and the ever-popular lighting talks. We'll be posting new details every day, so keep watching.</p>
<p>Registration is still open, and the <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/location.html">hotel block is open until August 24th</a>, so don't delay. Register today at <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/">ApacheCon.com</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to get involved, or have any more questions, there's a number of ways to get in touch with us.</p>
