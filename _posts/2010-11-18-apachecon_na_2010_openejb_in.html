  content: "\"There's a tendency for people to feel like they're getting a sales pitch
    despite the fact that all that we do, time and software, is given away for free.\".\r\n\r\nWell
    most masterpieces get this attitude in the beginning. It has nothing to do with
    OpenEJB. Most people feel inadequate in the face of perfection:D  This is something
    OpenEJB can be proud of! Plus, OpenEJB does pretty good on our production servers
    :-)  You see, I see a lot of eyebrows go up when I say \"OpenEJB can turn Tomcat
    into a production EJB container by simply putting a .war file on its webapps directory\".
    For many, its simply too good to believe. For others, they don't believe this
    can happen with even a 100MB heap.\r\n\r\nThanks for composing OpenEJB :-) Hats
    off!"

<p>Thanks to all who attended ApacheCon NA this last week in Atlanta, GA.  We had a nice little session Friday of the conference.  For those that weren't able to attend or for those who made it and wanted to share the slides, we're putting them up online for all to see.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure being able to present.  People attending presentations are often skeptical when things first get rolling.  There's a tendency for people to feel like they're getting a sales pitch despite the fact that all that we do, time and software, is given away for free.  When we got into the demos, what started as reserved and scrutinizing facial expressions turned into very excited faces with big bright smiles.  It was quite the transformation.</p>
<p>That excitement was triggered by the demos, which really drives home the importance of having more video content for people.  In that vein we plan to introduce a series of Lightening Demos.  Quick 2 minute screencasts so people can see individual examples run, download to debug!</p>
