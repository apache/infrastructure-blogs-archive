WHO: The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Recognized as one of the most compelling communities in Open Source for shepherding, developing, and incubating innovations &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, the ASF is responsible for millions of lines of code overseen by an all-volunteer community across six continents. Apache technologies power more than half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of operations, billions of objects, and enhance the lives of countless users and developers. WHAT: Apache Traffic Server v3.2.0, the Cloud Computing &quot;edge&quot; service able to handle requests in and out of the Cloud by a) serving static content (images, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files), and b) routing requests for dynamic content to a Web server (such as the Apache HTTP Server). V3.2.0 is the Project&#39;s latest stable release. Key highlights include: - Over 800 commits, and 300 JIRA tickets closed since v3.0. - Several SSL improvements, including SNI (Server Name Indication) and NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). Overall SSL stability is also improved. - Full IPv6 support, v3.0 only had client side IPv6. All IP related plugin APIs are now also IPv6 aware. - New, flexible configurations for managing inbound and outgoing IP addresses and ports. You can now bind any number, and combinations, of addresses and ports for both HTTP and HTTPS. - Range request for large objects in cache are now much (*much*) faster. - Several new, and improved, plugin APIs are now available. - Performance and stability improvements in the Cluster Cache feature. - Much better performance when proxying to a Keep-Alive HTTP backend server connection. Overall cache performance is also significantly better. - Several stable plugins are now included with the core distributions. - Supports all gcc versions 4.1.2 and higher, Clang / LLVM 3, and the Intel compiler suite.
