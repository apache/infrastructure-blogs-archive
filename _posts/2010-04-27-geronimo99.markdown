Welcome to the Apache Geronimo group blog!  This is the first post to the Apache Geronimo blog - so I thought a brief explanation of the intent and purpose of the blog was in order. 
</p>
<p>
The point of this group blog in the broadest sense is simply to have a place to talk about the Apache Geronimo project.    We hope that means that many people will contribute, each sharing a different view point.  More specifically, the goal is for this to be a place to highlight particular topics from time to time that people will find interesting.  It isn't intended to replace the general Geronimo mailing lists, web page, or documentation.   It is merely intended to highlight various items from time to time in a way that is timely and a little less intense than the content included in our mailing lists, wiki, documentation, or web pages.  Indeed, anything of particular importance here should also exist in one or more of those other places.  Naturally, we want to foster discussion but certain discussions (such as the gory details of some yet unresolved technical issue) are probably best kept on one of the mailing lists.   To borrow a line from the Apache Aries blog ..  "This is a place to celebrate achievements and to talk about some of the new and exciting things we are doing."  
</p>
<p>
We hope to have some real content soon ... for example I'm soon planning to add an entry with information on running several of the Apache Aries examples on Apache Geronimo .... I'll hopefully have that up shortly.
