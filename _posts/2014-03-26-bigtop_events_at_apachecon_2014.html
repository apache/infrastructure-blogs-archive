  content: "Thanks for blogging this cos.  See you folks there.  Super excited about
    taking bigtop to the next level with (1) more virtualization goodies (2) better
    CI with automatic format checking (3) possibly titrating bigpetstore into the
    mix.  \r\n\r\nSome other folks at red hat on my end will be there.  "

<p>Bigtop community will hold two events at the ApacheCon in Denver this year:</p>
<ol>
<li>April 7th, 6 pm: a meetup with talks about the technology, sharing the experience and socializing</li>
