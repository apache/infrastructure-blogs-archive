<p>The march of standards continues unabated. Legacy TLS protocols 1.0<br />
and 1.1 have varying weaknesses that could lead to a false sense of<br />
security.</p>
<p>
In June, in an effort to raise security and comply with modern<br />
standards, the insecure TLS 1.0 & 1.1 protocols will no longer be<br />
supported for SSL connections to Central. This should only affect<br />
users of Java 6 that are also using https to access central, which by<br />
our metrics is less than .2% of users.</p>
<p>
At the same time, this conversion will allow Central to support HTTP/2<br />
with potential performance gains for modern http clients.</p>
<p>
The details about why, when and what you need to do are documented at<br />
the link below. As questions come up, we will continue to update this<br />
faq.</p>
<p>
If there is specific information required for non-maven build systems,<br />
please send it along and we will include that as well.</p>
