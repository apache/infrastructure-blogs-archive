<p>The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.0-beta6 release!</p>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the eighth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community.</p>
<h3>Fixed Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-231:  Logger.getParent() was not returning the correct Logger.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-201:  Renamed Plugin annotation attribute from "type" to "category".</li>
<li>LOG4J2-219:  Fix: install default root logger if not configured (this is unchanged),<br />
        but make sure to include configured named loggers. Clarified documentation. Thanks to Peter DePasquale.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-159:  Use OSGi version format in Fragment-Host</li>
<li>LOG4J2-234:  RegexFilter threw a NullPointerException when used as a context-wide filter.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-192:  Add support for interpolating Environment variables when processing the configuration.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-235:  Removed dependency on tools jar from core module, made jconsole dependency optional. Thanks to Sebastian Oerding.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-233:  Fixed link to log4j-user mailing list.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-222:  Disruptor will now shutdown during Tomcat shutdown. Thanks to Steven Yang.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-224:  The FlumeAppender failed to start if the Flume RPCClient could not connect to any Flume agents.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-223:  Fix LoggerContext start and stop to eliminate IllegalStateException and NoClassDefFound errors.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-221:  Remove hundreds of compiler warnings. Thanks to Nick Williams.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-215:  Various small documentation fixes.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-217:  Ensure PluginManager streams are always closed. Thanks to Fabien Sanglard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-237:  Moved JMX Client GUI classes into separate jmx-gui submodule.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-230:  Improved error reporting when misconfigured. Thanks to Wojciech ZarÄ™ba.</li>
<li>Renamed AsynchAppender to AsyncAppender. Plugin name became Async (was Asynch).</li>
<li>Removed CheckStyle false positives for NewlineAtEndOfFile and whitespace following '*' at end of line in javadoc.</li>
<li>Moved Clock interface to package org.apache.logging.log4j.core.helpers.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-225:  Documentation updates to clarify use and impact of location in pattern layouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta5 requires a minimum of Java 6 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>

patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Apache Apache Log4j 2 website:</p>
