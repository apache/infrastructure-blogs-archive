  content: "Is government a business?\r\n\r\nI have been told that Open Office cannot
    be installed on computers at a senior citizen center because the center is owned
    and run by the city. That the center is therefore a government facility and that
    the eula for Open Office precludes the use of Open Office on senior citizen center
    computers i.e. Open Office cannot be used in a \"business facility\" with out
    a contract for business use (fees and charges are implied).\r\n\r\nThis argument
    does not seem correct to me. Am I missing something regarding Apache Open Office
    and open source?\r\n\r\n"

    getting it to recognize my browser.  I am on a Mac and I use Safari as my default
    browser.  I can't download any of the new extensions from OpenOffice.  When I
    click on the download notice, I get a message that says:  \"Error while installing
    extension writer2epub.oxst.  The error message is:  an error occured during file
    opening.  The extension will not be installed.\"\r\n - or -\r\n I get a message
    that says:  \r\n\"OpenOffic.org could not find a web browser on you system.  Please
    check your Desktop Preferences or install a web browser (for example, Mozilla)
    in the default location requested during the browser installation.\"\r\nNot sure
    what to do and can't find any answers in your forums.  Can you help?\r\n"

  content: "Good things where a certain amount of human capital is spend on, deserve
    also a certain reasonable reward for this I think.\r\n\r\nAlthough this reward
    then still doesn't need go directly to the developers. This could also be for
    example a foundation that supports the availability of affortable qualitative
    sw or that support the technical development of people less fortunate or lucky
    along us on the earth.\r\n\r\nSo is in this way what Open Office offers today,
    FOR FREE, in relation to a  billion organisation like Microsoft offering since
    20 years for a salty price with little improvements over those 20 years: FANTASTIC!
    \r\n\r\nAn amazing achievement of humanity for  humanity. "

  content: "I have published two book using OpenOffice.\r\nThe largest is 280 pages.
    \ The printer did an excellent job from my text sent as a PDF file.\r\n\r\nPage
    and graphic stability was a problem. If I left a graphic anchored to a page it
    spread across the whole document. Attaching it to a paragraph was stable. \r\n\r\nSome
    helpful changes if they have not been made.\r\nShow the grid scale values on menu
    bar.\r\nAlso, show scales of objects on bottom panel.\r\nWould be nice to be able
    to crop all graphic types.\r\nMouse screen crossings are a problem.\r\nKeep the
    drive active ON Wheel as long as the drive is active.  I lost two DVD backup disk
    and I think it was because I tried to save again while the DVD drive was still
    active on a previous save.   This may be a Microsoft Wonder 7 problem, They screwed
    up the user interface and left out many possible features.\r\nThanks\r\n"

    and other big corps think they can make more money by releasing upgrades that
    are not compatible with previous( ie .doc vs .docx )\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE are just
    monentary vehicles.\r\n\r\nOPEN OFFICE is a model of compatibility and <<even
    though I can provide copies of MS_OFFICE2010>>\r\n\r\nI recommend OPEN OFFICE
    and I point out why it is better (not just Free)\r\none big point is the example
    of the compatibility of OFFICE2003 vs OFFICE2007"

<h2>Apache OpenOffice&trade; 3.4.1 launches, with more languages, improved performance and stability. <br /></h2>
<p>(This announcement is also available in <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/it/stampa/comunicati/aoo341.html">Italian</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/fr/AOO_annonce_3_4_1.html">French</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-cn/news/aoo341.html">Simplified</a> and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-tw/news/aoo341.html">Traditional Chinese</a>.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> project is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1, the latest release of the free and open community-developed productivity suite.&nbsp; This maintenance release builds upon the success of Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0, which has been downloaded <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/">over 12 million times</a> by users in 228 countries, and adds further language support, platform compatibility, performance enhancements and bug fixes.&nbsp; OpenOffice 3.4.1 can be downloaded now from <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">http://www.openoffice.org/download/ </a>or by going to the the Help/Check for Updates dialog within OpenOffice 3.4 or 3.3.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> (formerly OpenOffice.org) is undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at Apache.</p>
<p> Complete details for the contents of the 3.4.1 release can be found in the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/development/releases/3.4.1.html">release notes</a>.&nbsp; Highlights include: </p>
<ul>
<li>New support for Khmer, Finnish, British English, Slovenian and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/sk/">Slovak</a> languages. &nbsp; The Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Hungarian translations have also been improved.&nbsp; Along with US English, German, Japanese, Czech, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Gallician and Arabic, this brings the number of languages supported to 20.</li>
<li>Support for Microsoft Windows XP up to Windows 8 (32-bit), Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, and Apple Mac OS, including Mountain Lion.&nbsp; New to this release are compatibility fixes for improved operation in Microsoft Windows 8.</li>
<li>Enhancements in performance, interoperability and security</li>
<li>Fixes for 69 bugs reported by users.</li>
<li>Community members are also working on BSD, Solaris and OS/2 ports.&nbsp; More information can be found on our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/porting/">OpenOffice Porting Project</a> page</li>
</ul>
<p>Apache OpenOffice users also have access to broad ecosystem of 3rd party enhancements. The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/blog/apache-openoffice-extensions-and-templates-new-features-available/">newly renovated</a> <a href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/">Extensions</a> and <a href="http://templates.openoffice.org/">Templates</a> websites, re-engineered and hosted by SourceForge,<br />
currently feature 2388 templates and 628 extensions.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h2>Future Releases and Invitation to Submit Ideas<br /></h2>
<p>In parallel with work on the Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 maintenance release, project members have also been working on changes for the 3.5 release.&nbsp; Areas of focus for 3.5 include: improved MS Office interoperability, performance, stability, usability and support of additional languages.&nbsp; We are targeting the first quarter of 2013 for Apache OpenOffice 3.5.0.</p>
<p>A major update, Apache OpenOffice 4.0, will follow, including additional features and improvements merged in from the the IBM Lotus Symphony code recently contributed to Apache.&nbsp; There is also opportunity in this release to think "outside of the box" and bring additional innovation.</p>
<p>As a project we are starting to brainstorm about what could be possible in Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp; We invite OpenOffice users, community members and other interested parties to join us in this process, to help make version 4.0 the kind of radical success that version 1.0 was over a decade ago.&nbsp; We're using <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/">Google Moderator</a> to collect and rate ideas. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=2011d5">Please join us and share your ideas</a>.</p>
<h2>Volunteers <br /></h2>
