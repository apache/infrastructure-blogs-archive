<div> 
    <p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) held its annual Members' meeting this May. Among the Foundation's business that takes place during this meeting is the election of new ASF Members.</p> 
    <p>At its inception in 1999, The ASF comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group formed the Foundation's core membership.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>This group grew with &quot;Committers&quot;, developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership: </p> 
    <p>&nbsp; 1) to &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; (contribute) directly to the code repository; </p> 
    <p>&nbsp; 2) the right to vote on community-related decisions; and </p> 
    <p>&nbsp; 3) and the ability propose an active user for Committership</p> 
    <p> </p> 
    <p>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation’s growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing members. There are currently 468 active Apache Members.</p> 
  </div>
