This group grew with Committers â€”developers who contributed code, patches, documentation, and other contributions, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;to "commit" or "write" directly to Apache code repositories as well as make non-code contributions;</li><li>&nbsp;the right to vote on community-related decisions; and</li><li>&nbsp;the ability to propose an active contributor for Committership.</li></ul><p>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation's growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing Members.</p><p>This election brings the total number of ASF Members to 853 today. Individuals elected as ASF Members legally serve as the "shareholders" of the Foundation <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html" target="_blank">https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html</a></p><p>For more information on how the ASF works, visit <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Apache Is Open <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache-is-open" target="_blank">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache-is-open</a> and&nbsp;</p><p>Briefing: The Apache Way <a href="http://apache.org/theapacheway/" target="_blank">http://apache.org/theapacheway/</a></p><p># # #</p>
