 <br/><br />
 <br/><br />
<b>New features available in v6.0.0:</b><br />

<b>UI partially migrated to build using NPM and dependency management</b><br/><br />
Most of the UI code relevant for the conference room has been migrated to be built using NPM and split into multiple partials that built separated. This enables using NPM and dependency management as well as a way to develop JavaScript which is more familiar for a lot of Front End Developers!<br />
