<p>Finally, the Tiles test webapp has been transformed into a portlet-based webapp. You can check it from <a href="http://svn.eu.apache.org/repos/asf/tiles/framework/trunk/tiles-test/" title="Tiles test in the trunk">the SVN trunk</a> or the <a href="http://svn.eu.apache.org/repos/asf/tiles/framework/branches/TILES_2_1_X/tiles-test/" title="Tiles test in the TILES_2_1_X branch.">Tiles 2.1.x branch</a>.</p><p>After a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/TILES-466" title="A bug in portlet support">bug fix</a>, the portlet support in Tiles work. <br /></p><p>This portlet does not do much: it asks for a definition name and tries to render it. The portlet has been tried with JBoss Portal 2.7.2.</p><p> Currently it only works with complete definitions that are based on JSP pages. Velocity and FreeMarker do not work simply because they are based on servlets<br /></p>
