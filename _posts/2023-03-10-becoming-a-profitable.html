<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering cloud solutions need not be as complex and costly as some would have thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements, as proIO discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.proio.com/" target="_blank">proIO</a> was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Br&uuml;seke explains. &ldquo;We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts, providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth day-to-day running of operations.&rdquo;, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swen Br&uuml;seke, CEO of proIO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started by remotely looking after its customer&rsquo;s physical servers and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.</span></p>

<p><strong>–ê Move to CloudStack</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as Swen explained. &ldquo;We had used it for several years on various other projects, and so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.</span></p>
<p><strong>Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, more than 95% of proIO&rsquo;s virtual machines are Linux based. &ldquo;Our customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or not,&rdquo; explained Swen. &ldquo;They just want their apps to run to support their business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community, contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.&rdquo;, says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swen Br&uuml;seke, CEO of proIO.</span></p>
