<meta name="description" content="In the works over the past year (v2.0 was released May 2010), Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0 is the result of contributions from more than 30 developers and contributors. Technical highlights include: I. Contributions - Over 1,000 &quot;commits&quot; (code, patches, or documentation written directly to the code repository); - 380+ bug tickets resolved; - 10 releases have been made during the development phase (v2.1.0 - 2.1.9) II. New features/improvements - Full 64-bit support; - Client side IPv6 support; - WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol); - Clustering is functional and supported (many benefits include an efficient distributed cache); - Major plug-in API improvements, making the APIs more feature rich and easier to use; - Support for many platforms, including OSX, Solaris and FreeBSD (Linux, of course, was always supported); - New improved RAM cache algorithms, for better performance and memory utilization - Many configurations are now configurable per transaction (or per mapping rule) - Many improvements in statistics and management APIs; - Multiple accept threads, and a dedicated DNS thread: - Build environment is now much more flexible, and package owner friendly; - Many, many bug fixes for improved stability and functionality. III. Performance improvements - Overall throughput is 2-3x improved over v2.0 (depending on the traffic patterns) - Response latency is up to 5x better than v2.0 - Benchmark: Serving small objects out of RAM cache, a high end server has showed over 220,000 requests / second - Benchmark: Serving small objects that are not cacheable, the same high end server could proxy 100,000 requests / second (NOTE: all benchmarks are on local network, with keep-alive) Get Involved!
