<p>Dr. Dobb's has a great article titled <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/java/222601023">Coarse-Grained Unit Testing: Using OpenEJB and DBUnit to write repeatable unit tests for Java components</a>which shows how to combine OpenEJB with DBUnit to get a very effective testing setup.  The article is complete with an example based on the fictitious Blue Star Galactic spaceship company.  All source code is available to download.</p>
