Roller was installed today for the use of ASF Projects. Those committers with personal blogs should instead add their feed to planet.apache.org.

Still a few things to sort out, but blogs.apache.org is mostly ready.

Any project that wants a blog, please can a PMC member email infra or create a jira issuse.

Thanks and Enjoy!
