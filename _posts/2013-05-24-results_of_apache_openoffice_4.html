  content: These logos deserve to here. They are pretty much resembling the power
    of Apache OpenOffice. I'd like to congratulate the designers; very well done.

  content: "Vasilis, Robin, and Chris R hands down are the top 3 logos here and it
    isn't even close in my opinion yet I respect we all have different ideas. \r\n\r\nVasilis
    - favorite most unique and strong going forward. Best design if you want to reinvent
    and have cool elements of meaning attached to the logo. The initials, infinity,
    4 the version can be updated easily, yet retains the original look for the text.
    Gets furthest away from microsoft style branding. \r\n\r\nRobin - awesome fresh
    design that looks very professional and \"desirable\". Best design to keep the
    original elements and be different. Different from microsoft branding. \r\n\r\nChris
    R - best close to original logo simple option. It is clean and fresh and a simple
    update if you want to update the \"can of soda\" so to speak. "

    that seeing all the high quality logos together I'm very drawn to Robin Fowler's.
    \ I think it's a very strong graphic - the traditional seagulls becoming a book
    and the feather reminding a would-be writer of a quill.\r\nI agree with David
    Motkin, too, though - I'm not sure adding the version number is the best idea.\r\nCongratulations
    to all the entries, some excellent work here."

  content: "Thanks for letting us know the results! Of the choices you've provided,
    my ranking of favorites is:\r\n\r\n#1 is Samer Mansour's \"on the left\" with
    the thinner lettering.  \r\n\r\n#2 is \"anonymous\"\r\n\r\nI like Mansour's better
    because the blue circle is larger, and with the thinner lettering it looks lighter
    and more \"open\" which is in keeping with the name of the app. Likewise, \"anonymous\"
    has lighter (\"weight\") lettering than Mansour's other submission. "

    to Samer Mansour whose two logos are strong and appealling, with simplicity that
    complements the Apache OpenOffice suite perfectly without distraction. If I must
    chose between Samer Mansour's two logos, I would chose number 1 [or perhaps number
    2, or perhaps spin a coin (smile)].

  content: I personally prefer the "Chris R." logo out of the lot. The general theme
    seems to be a more metro, flat redesign of the original one, without any significant
    changes or additions. Which is fine, but the chosen typeface, line weight, and
    placement is extremely critical. Most of the "simple" designs above are rather
    horrible with a few exceptions, even the ones mentioned at the very top. Also
    would it be too much to ask for if you removed the trademark and the Apache branding
    from the main logo itself? We get it, it's yours, but it still feels a bit too
    intrusive. There isn't any rule or law requiring it either.

  content: Definitely either of the designs from Vasilis Xenofontos or Robin Fowler.
    These obviously received the most strong votes because they are so much more developed
    and polished than the other contenders. IMO the other logos look extremely dated
    and underdeveloped; as in they look like some rough rudimentary logo and some
    text slapped next to it.

  content: As for the theme of the actual logo itself, I'd personally go with either
    a properly designed and adjusted flat, simplified one with the birds, or something
    completely radical and new. The book icon for example is extremely well done,
    although without the feather or the asymmetrical text. Still, I could see it working
    as a complete redesign, plus I love the idea of the current bird shapes forming
    the outline of a book. Go with either of these two guys. That's my 0.02$ anyways.

    the group for last selection. It is the most innovative. I like the triple loop
    icon. The inferences to \"Object Oriented\" combined with infinity and yet attached
    to the  \"a\" are clever. The gulls have been beautifully retained and are like
    shadows that lift the icon. I assume that the main Version number is only used
    where appropriate. Like Robin Fowler's submission the logo can be squared off
    or given a portrait shape for a desktop shortcut or file association icon. \r\nQuestions:
    \r\n   Does Apache have to SHOUT? \r\n   Can the three words be stacked and centered
    when the logo is required for portrait or square mode?"

    the gulls is a masterful concept and inclusion of the "Apache" feather is icing

    I'd like it more if the border on the cicle were a tad more narrow--as it would
    make it more airy.

    as well as symbolically.\r\nIt may be improved by placing the feather diagonally
    within the circle and behind the 'book', symbolizing an old fashioned writing
    instrument (pen) and cleaning up the logo at the same time. While the concept
    of adding the feather separately gets full marks, I find that it has a somewhat
    cluttering effect.\r\n\r\nWell done Robin!"

  content: I like the results. I think the next step would be to ask the designers
    to render their designs in strict black and white, since it will be used across
    different collateral. Consideration should be given to how the symbol communicates
    when the type can't be present as sometimes it will need to do this. (think Nike,
    Apple, Amazon) Sometimes the pretty one doesn't always solve the problem.

  content: I like Michael Acevedo's smaller logo (the one on the right).  Large logos
    in general appear to overpower the page where they are located and give the impression
    of shouting.  I also like the idea of incorporating the base version number in
    the logo for clarity (a simple "4" in this case).  As for having capitals in the
    logo, that should be determined by the configuration of the words in accordance
    with the copyright registration.

<p>A quick update on our recent logo survey for Apache OpenOffice 4.0. &nbsp; We called on community members to submit proposals for a new project logo.&nbsp; The response was huge.&nbsp; We received over 40 logo proposals.&nbsp; To narrow down the choices we sought out feedback from users.&nbsp;&nbsp; We created a survey asking users to rate each logo on a 5-point scale, from Strongly Dislike to Strongly Like, as well as give an optional comment on each logo.&nbsp; The survey ran for one week and 5028 responses were received.&nbsp; Full details of the results can be found in the <a href="http://survey.openoffice.org/reports/aoo40-logo-poll/">Apache OpenOffice Logo Survey Report</a>.&nbsp; In this blog post we want to highlight some of the highest scoring logos, recognize the designers, and talk about next steps.</p></p>

<p>Samer Mansour, a software developer and an engaged citizen in his<br />
community in Toronto, aimed for "simple and flat" with his designs, "I had<br />
an a-ha moment when I<br />
 saw another volunteer's flat logo. I had learned from design experts at<br />
 work that thin font is the trend and is appealing to users, so I<br />
narrowed it down to put together a wordmark from an Apache licensed font<br />
that fit the bill." </p>

<p>Two of the top-scoring logo proposals came from Kevin Grignon, an OpenOffice contributor and a user<br />
experience designer with over&nbsp;15 years experience&nbsp;designing user<br />
interfaces and application graphics.&nbsp; In his submissions,<br />
Kevin aimed to leverage some aspects of the&nbsp;existing branding, while<br />
modifying and&nbsp;enhancing other elements.&nbsp;&nbsp; As he explains, "Given the large number of<br />
graphic assets that would require updating in a refresh, my<br />
submissions retain familiar and recognizable&nbsp;elements including the&nbsp;orb<br />
element and logo type layout, which would allow a scaled rollout of the<br />
new logo. Other elements of the logo submissions were enhanced,<br />
including the curvature of the&nbsp;document/gulls or&nbsp;the use of a a stylized<br />
 feather, a colour palette which harmonizes well with proposed<br />
individual product icons, the use of a globe element, and logo type<br />
colouring which emphasizes the word "open" -&nbsp;which is our<br />
differentiator." </p>

<p>Michael Acevedo is a college student studying Aviation technology in Florida, how humans and<br />
technology interact while the aircraft is in operation and finding ways to<br />
improve that relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp; He explains his design process as, "I aimed in the&nbsp;design&nbsp;of the new<br />
 AOO 4 logo for something that was simple (hence why I went with a<br />
non&nbsp;capitalized&nbsp;design for the OpenOffice name) yet being something<br />
refreshing to reflect the rebirth of Apache OpenOffice. The challenge<br />
was how to create a logo that could reflect that philosophy yet being<br />
respectful and familiar to the outgoing Apache OpenOffice logo. Taking<br />
that into account, my proposed designs offer just<br />
that, something refreshing and simple, while at the same time staying<br />
true to the brand and image that has made OpenOffice their default<br />
office suite for the last 13 years or so."</p></p>

<p>You can see the top scoring design above, by Chris Rottensteiner, a webworker and genetic genealogist<br />
              from South Tyrol in the Alps. He supports the free digital<br />
              data flow and open elaboration trough FOSS software. "I'm<br />
                a clean flat style fan and tried to make something<br />
                without glossy or other "modish" elements: the brand<br />
                should speak for itself. For this second and much better<br />
                proposal from me I got inspired by Kevin Grignon and the<br />
                Source Sans Pro font. If the consensus is v4 should<br />
                receive a logo built on the existing version, I would<br />
                be happy to work on possible improvements. P.S.: the<br />
                work was done in Inkscape (SVG), a piece of software I<br />
                love."</p></p>

<p>This design, and the next one, although they were not top scorers when measured by average score, were the logos that received the most number of "Strongly Like" selections.&nbsp; So they had more enthusiastic support than the other logos.&nbsp; The above design, from Robin Fowler, takes the traditional gulls element of the OpenOffice.org logo and makes them dynamic, while also suggesting the form of an open book.&nbsp; In Robin's words, "My goal for the logo was to take the traditional elements of the OpenOffice logo and give it more of a connection to the software itself. I<br />
kept the sphere similar to the original, adding a border to make it look<br />
 more like an app icon. My initial idea was to take the birds and use<br />
them to form a book. The first attempts were fairly crude but I got some<br />
 valuable feedback from the mailing list and managed to improve it<br />
somewhat. The feather was added to resemble the new 'Apache era' of OpenOffice."</p>

<p>Vasilis Xenofontos, a visionary art<br />
designer from the small island of Cyprus aimed for a modern and easy<br />
to remember logo design. "I did this design trying to show that<br />
OpenOffice will be here forever and that&rsquo;s why the logo has the infinity circles in it forming the letters AOO. The two colors in<br />
it symbolize the sea and the sky showing that this software is free<br />
and all over the world."</p>
<hr /></p>
<p>So what are the next steps in this logo exploration?&nbsp;&nbsp; The designers of the above logos have been invited to review user comments from the survey and based on that feedback submit revised logos.&nbsp; We'll then review the revisions, discuss and pick the new logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual at Apache we try to reach consensus by discussion wherever possible, and only vote if necessary.&nbsp; The above logos already show a good deal of sharing of ideas.&nbsp; The constructive feedback among the designers and the Apache OpenOffice community should lead us to a wonderful new logo for a wonderful new release, Apache OpenOffice 4.0.</p>
<p>Congratulations, obviously, to the top logos, but thanks go out to all those who contributed logos for consideration, as well as to the 5000 users who took time to rate and comment on these designs.</p>
