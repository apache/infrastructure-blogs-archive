<meta name="description" content="Open Source version control system ranked among leaders in $970MM+ market Wakefield, MA &mdash;16 April 2018&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache&reg; Subversion&reg; v1.10.0, the popular centralized software version control system. With Apache Subversion, files and directories can be edited, copied, deleted, merged, and tagged, with each such operation leaving a permanent entry in the version control system&#39;s history record. Files can be locked for exclusive access. The system supports a command-line interface and several third-party graphical interfaces, and can also be scripted in Python, Perl, Ruby, or Java. Subversion is very portable and runs on virtually all general-purpose operating systems in use today. The software versioning and revision control system initiated in 2000, entered the Apache Incubator in 2009, and graduated as an Apache Top-Level Project in 2010. &quot;Dealing with merge conflicts is one of the most complicated aspects of version control. While merge conflicts in a text file are usually best resolved by editing the file directly, merge conflicts can also occur when the directory tree structure of a project is changed. Resolving such structural conflicts requires users to manipulate entire collections of files and directories at once, which is time-consuming and error-prone,&quot; said Stefan Sperling, Vice President of Apache Subversion. &quot;With Subversion 1.10, structural conflicts can now be resolved with support from a built-in interactive conflict resolver which automates conflict resolution tasks users had to perform manually in the past. This is a major usability improvement and saves users who do a lot of merging a significant amount of time.&quot; Apache Subversion 1.10 is the result of more than three years&rsquo; development effort, and features: Numerous bug fixes Improved path-based authorization New interactive conflict resolver LZ4 compression support over the wire and backend storage Shelving (experimental) The full list of new features can be found in the project release notes at https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.10.html In its new &quot;Version Control Systems Market: Global Industry Analysis&quot; report, Future Market Insights estimates that the version control systems market will exhibit 11.5% CAGR and reach US$971.8MM by 2027.
