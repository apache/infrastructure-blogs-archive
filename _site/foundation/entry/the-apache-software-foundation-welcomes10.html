<meta name="description" content="The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) welcomes the following new Members who were elected during the annual ASF Members&#39; Meeting on 9 and 11 March 2021: Maxime Beauchemin, Bolke de Bruin, Wei-Chiu Chuang, Jiangjie (Becket), Pablo Estrada, Dave Grove, Madhawa Kasun Gunasekara, Nathan Hartman, Tilman Hausherr, Georg Henzler, Xiangdong Huang, Nikita Ivanov, Yu Li, Geoff Macartney, Denis A.

The ASF incorporated in 1999 with a core membership of 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group grew with Committers &mdash;developers who contributed code, patches, documentation, and other contributions, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership: &nbsp;to &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; directly to Apache code repositories as well as make non-code contributions; &nbsp;the right to vote on community-related decisions; and &nbsp;the ability to propose an active contributor for Committership. Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation&#39;s growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing Members. This election brings the total number of ASF Members to 853 today.
