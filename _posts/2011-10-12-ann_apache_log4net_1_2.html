<p>The Apache log4net team is pleased to announce the release of Apache<br />
log4net 1.2.11.  The release is available for download at</p>
<p>       <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download.html</a></p>
<p>The Apache log4net library is a tool to help the programmer output log<br />
statements to a variety of output targets.  log4net is a port of the<br />
excellent Apache log4j framework to the Microsoft(R) .NET runtime.</p>
<p>log4net 1.2.11 is not only a bugfix release, it also adds support for<br />
.NET 4.0 as well as the client profiles of .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0.<br />
See the release-notes at</p>
<p>   <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html</a></p>
<p>for a full list of changes.</p>
<p>Starting with this release log4net uses a new strong name key but we<br />
also provide a binary distribution using the "old" strong name key of<br />
log4net 1.2.10 and earlier. See the FAQ at</p>
<p>       <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#two-snks">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#two-snks</a></p>
<p>for details.</p>
<p>The binary distributions no longer contain assemblies built for the<br />
Compact Framework 1.0 or the Shared Source CLI - you can build those<br />
yourself using the source distribution.</p>
