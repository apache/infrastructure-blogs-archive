Finally, a book is available on the Click framework that provides a great way for getting started quickly.</p>
<p>From the website: </p>
<blockquote><p>This<br />
book will help you get started with this excellent framework, starting<br />
with the basics and moving on to creating a sample application. You'll<br />
also learn how to integrate popular third-party frameworks such as<br />
Spring, Hibernate, Java Persistence API (JPA), and more. </p></blockquote>
<p>There is also a chapter on authentication and authorization which integrates Click and <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>, an open source security framework also hosted at Apache.</p>
