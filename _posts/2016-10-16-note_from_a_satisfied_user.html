<p>We received the following mail from Mr. Ziegler on the developer mailing list [1] and we want to share it with all of you:</p>
<p>Quote start</p>
<p><i>I was encouraged to leave my aoo forum post directly in the dev mailing<br />
list so that you all can read what I wanted to express. I am not a<br />
software developper in any sense--only a user.</p>
<p>Dear developers,<br />
</i> <i><br />there may be little positive feedback for your work, I guess. So I<br />
created an account for the forum (and now subscribed temporarily to<br />
dev@aoo) to leave a big THANK YOU!</p>
<p>The&nbsp; first version I used must have been something like StarOffice<br />
4.3, the&nbsp; first I owned was SO 5.2, and then I shifted to<br />
OpenOffice(.org) when it&nbsp; introduced the XML file formats. So I am a<br />
convinced and longterm user&nbsp; since then and hardly ever regretted my<br />
decision.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>OpenOffice&nbsp; gave me the possibility to mostly do what I wanted to<br />
(with writer,&nbsp; base, calc, impress and draw - in that historic order) in<br />
 an efficient&nbsp; way, and the only thing I don't like is, that it always<br />
tends towards following&nbsp; MS Office although it already was better in<br />
many ways. I understand that it is&nbsp; crucial to get as many users as<br />
possible, so I acknowledge the decisions&nbsp; towards MS Office.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>What I like most is the long term usability&nbsp; and stability, and I do<br />
 not only keep my office files from more than 10&nbsp; years ago, I also use<br />
and re-use them. And if one crashed in the past, I nearly&nbsp; always could<br />
recover them by opening the zip bundle with an (hex) editor.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>By that, I&nbsp; enjoyed the progress in LibreOffice, but didn't really<br />
need it. Although&nbsp; I switched to LibreOffice on some machines, I am<br />
always glad that there&nbsp; is OpenOffice, too. In my eyes, it is the more<br />
stable and efficient&nbsp; branch of the project. This year it was my<br />
fallback tool and salvation&nbsp; in a book project that I started with LO<br />
Writer;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first invested hours to get my pictures back to the place<br />
they&nbsp; belonged to when they got more and more (as others did decades<br />
before&nbsp; with MS Word) and then had to give up as it didn't open the file<br />
 anymore&nbsp; without crashing. Apache OpenOffice (standard and portable)<br />
solved the problem. It got a nice book, by&nbsp; the way, for our church<br />
jubilee.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>So if you get the software&nbsp; maintained, I will probably continue to<br />
use OpenOffice for another 20&nbsp; years. And I won't switch to DTP software<br />
 (Scribus) for the next book&nbsp; project neither like I regularly do for<br />
magazines, brochures etc.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>OpenOffice is a great, great software, even if it didn't evolve much<br />
 in the last years! (maybe even: because..)&nbsp;&nbsp; Powerful enough for both<br />
private and standard business use.<br />
</i> <i></p>
<p>Keep patience and persistance!<br />

<p>A very satisfied and content user </i> </p>
