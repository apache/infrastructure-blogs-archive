    <p><strong><em>Major release of the cornerstone of the Big Data ecosystem, from which dozens of Apache Big Data projects and countless industry solutions originate.</em></strong></p> 
    <p><strong><em></em></strong><strong>Forest Hill, MD —5 June 2017—</strong> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today momentum with Apache® Hadoop® v2.8, the latest version of the Open Source software framework for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.</p>

  <div> 
    <p>Now ten years old, Apache Hadoop dominates the greater Big Data ecosystem as the flagship project and community amongst the ASF's more than three dozen projects in the category.</p> 
    <p>&quot;Apache Hadoop 2.8 maintains the project's momentum in its stable release series,&quot; said Chris Douglas, Vice President of Apache Hadoop. &quot;Our community of users, operators, testers, and developers continue to evolve the thriving Big Data ecosystem at the ASF. We're committed to sustaining the scalable, reliable, and secure platform our greater Hadoop community has built over the last decade.&quot;</p> 
    <p>Apache Hadoop supports processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing environment. The project has been regularly lauded by industry analysts worldwide for driving market transformation. Forrester Research estimates that firms will spend US$800M in Hadoop software and related services in 2017. According to Zion Market Research, the global Hadoop market is expected to reach approximately US$87.14B by 2022, growing at a CAGR of around 50% between 2017 and 2022.</p>

  <div>Apache Hadoop 2.8 is the result of 2 years of extensive collaborative development from the global Apache Hadoop community. With 2,914 commits as new features, improvements and bug fixes since v2.7, highlights include:</div> 
  <div> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Several important security related enhancements, including Hadoop UI protection of Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS) which is an attack that combines malicious JavaScript with an iframe that loads a legitimate page in an effort to steal data from an unsuspecting user, and Hadoop REST API protection of Cross site request forgery (CSRF) attack which attempt to force an authenticated user to execute functionality without their knowledge.<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>Support for Microsoft Azure Data Lake as a source and destination of data. This benefits anyone deploying Hadoop in Microsoft's Azure Cloud. The Azure Data Lake service was actually developed for Hadoop and analytics workloads.<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>The &quot;S3A&quot; client for working with data stored in Amazon S3 has been radically enhanced for scalability, performance, and security. The performance enhancements were driven by Apache Hive and Apache Spark benchmarks. In Hive TCP-DS benchmarks, Apache Hadoop is currently faster working with columnar data stored in S3 &nbsp;than Amazon EMR's closed-source connector. This shows the benefit of collaborative Open Source development.<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>Several WebHDFS related enhancements include integrated CSRF prevention filter in WebHDFS, support OAuth2 in WebHDFS, disallow/allow snapshots via WebHDFS, and more.<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>Integration with other applications has been improved with a separate jar for the hdfs-client than the hadoop-hdfs JAR with all the server side code. Downstream projects that access HDFS can depend on the hadoop-hdfs-client module to reduce the amount of transitive classpath dependencies.<br /><br /></li> 
      <li>YARN NodeManager Resource Reconfiguration through RM Admin CLI for a live cluster that allows YARN clusters to have a more flexible resource model especially for a Cloud deployment.</li> 
    </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div> </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>In addition to physical Hadoop clusters, where the majority of storage and computation lies, Apache Hadoop is very popular within Cloud infrastructures. Contributions from Apache Hadoop's diverse community includes improvements provided by Cloud infrastructure vendors and large Hadoop-in-Cloud users. These improvements include: Azure and S3 storage and YARN reconfiguration in particular, improve Hadoop's deployment on and integration with Cloud Infrastructures. The improvements in Hadoop 2.8 enable Cloud-deployed clusters to be more dynamic in sizing, adapting to demand by scaling up and down.</p> 
    <p>&quot;My colleagues and I are happy that tests of Apache Hive and Hadoop 2.8 show that we are able to provide a similar experience reading data in from S3 as Amazon EMR, with its closed-source fork/rewrite of S3,&quot; said Steve Loughran, member of the Apache Hadoop Project Management Committee.</p> 
    <p>Hailed as a &quot;Swiss army knife of the 21st century&quot; by the Media Guardian Innovation Awards &nbsp;and &quot;the most important software you’ve never heard of…helped enable both Big Data and Cloud computing&quot; by author Thomas Friedman, Apache Hadoop is used by an array of companies such as Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, AOL, Apple, eBay, Facebook, foursquare, IBM, HP, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, The New York Times, Rackspace, SAP, &nbsp;Tencent, Teradata, Tesla Motors, Uber, and Twitter. Yahoo, an early pioneer, hosts the world's largest known Hadoop production environment to date, spanning more than 38,000 nodes.</p>
