<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack</strong></span></p>
<p>Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph, TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.</p>
<p>Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack&rsquo;s Advanced networking model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and grow.</p>

<p><em><span>&ldquo;One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects - usually licensing and governance problems.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an open-source cloud management solution designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.
