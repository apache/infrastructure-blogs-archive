<p>The Apache&reg; OpenOffice&reg; Project is on the road to a bigger update for<br />
the leading open source office suite.<br />
<br><br />
<br>This is your chance. OpenOffice needs people to help in the development<br />
process. Don't panic, you do not need to be a software engineer or<br />
programmer though those skills are always welcome. You can already<br />
contribute a lot if you just install the software and test it for<br />
quality, reliability, language translations and submit bug reports,<br />
write documentation, and many other tasks as well.<br />
<br><br />
<br>If this sounds like something that you would be interested in then join<br />
with many others from all over the world on our development mailing list<br />
by sending an e-mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:dev-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">dev-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a> and join the fun (<a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html" target="_blank">more information about mailing lists</a>).</p>
