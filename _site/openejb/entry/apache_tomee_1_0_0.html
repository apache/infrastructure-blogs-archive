<meta name="description" content="It&#39;s time! Apache TomEE 1.0.0-beta-2 and Apache OpenEJB 4.0.0-beta-2 are finally out! These releases are major improvements over their predecessors and incorporate heavy doses user feedback and road testing. Nicely balanced at 50% bug fixes, 30% improvement of existing features, and 20% filling out features for better production and test experience, Apache TomEE is a major leap toward. Based on feedback of 1.0.0-beta-2, a final release could be right around the corner. Top among the areas to show the most improvement include CDI and JAX-RS, both of which received major attention. Support for an Arquillian adapter for TomEE Embedded is a must-not-miss new feature. The project itself has been taking a test-first approach to support and has amassed a rapidly growing number of tests for all the issues reported during the 1.0.0-beta-1 cycle. An Arquillian adapter for remote Apache TomEE usage does exist as a snapshot and should make it into the next release. As well this release boasts over 70 example applications, making a remarkable resource that cannot be ignored. See the downloads page for the full changelog. Get the binaries while they&#39;re hot! Thank you so much to all the users who gave feedback and contributed towards the quality of the release. We&#39;re very lucky to have gotten exactly the kind of user feedback were after with the 1.0.0-beta-1 release and we couldn&#39;t be prouder of the results." />
