Hi All,<br /><br />There will be a planned reboot of Jira on Thursday 21st May at 16:00 UTC+1<br /><br />This is 72 hours notice as recommended in our Core Services planned downtime SLA.<br /><br />Currently, Jira requires a reboot when adding new projects to it. There is an outstanding <br />ticket with Atlassian about this. They require logs and so these will be gathered at the <br />time of the planned reboot. <br /><br />Projects being added to Jira at this time will include:-<br /><br />INFRA-9516 - Myriad <br />INFRA-9609 - Atlas <br />INFRA-9635 - CMDA <br /><br />and any more that get requested between now and downtime.<br /><br />Any projects requiring issues to be imported from other issue trackers will NOT be done at <br />this time.<br /><br />A tweet via @infrabot will be tweeted 24 hrs and 1 hr before.<br />A planned maintenance notice will be posted on status.apache.org.<br /><br />Actual downtime should be no more than 10 minutes all being well.<br /><br />The next email about this will be after the service has resumed from the planned downtime.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Gavâ€¦<br />
