<p>Last Saturday (28th November 2009) was the first ever London Java Community Unconference. I had never been to an unconference so I decided to go along and see what unconferences were all about. The first thing I knew was that I had to take a presentation along, so I decided to take a presentation along about Apache Aries. Given that "Enterprise OSGi" is new I also covered this as well.</p>
<p>The way it worked was that anyone wishing to give a presentation wrote their talk title on a post it and put it on the agenda. People them came along to the talks they were interested in. I ended up choosing a session in the afternoon and when I started my presentation there were about 30 people in the room. The talk went well and I was glad to see so much interest in Apache Aries and Enterprise OSGi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you want to see my slides they are <a href="http://blogs.apache.org/aries/resource/ljc-apache-aries.pdf" title="here">here</a>.</p>
