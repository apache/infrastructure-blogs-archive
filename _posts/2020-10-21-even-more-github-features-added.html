<p>Available as of yesterday, more self serve features were added to the .asf.yaml toolset, based around Github Branch Protection.</p>
<p>You can now add the following features :-</p>
<ul>
<li>Github Branch Protection Enable/Disable</li>
<li>Require Status Checks to pass before merging</li>
<li>Require Branches to be up to date before merging</li>
<li>Context Status Checks (i.e. this build/check must pass before merging)</li>
<li>Require Pull Request Reviews</li>
<li>Dismiss Stale Pull requests</li>
<li>Require Code Owner Reviews</li>
<li>Minimum number of approvals of reviews</li>
<li>Require Signed Signatures on commits</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these features, like enable/disable protection of branches and required signatures will send an email to the projects private list with details.</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/pull/1678" target="_blank">PR</a> for more details on code and implementation.</p>
<p>Infra especially thanks Bryan Ellis (erisu) for opening the PR, providing the code and persisting all the way through a long standing PR until&nbsp;<br>it was finally implemented, with tweaks by Humbedooh to see it over the finish line.<br></p>
<p>See this Infra cwiki page for example implementation:-</p>

<p>If you haven't yet discovered the joys of what .asf.yaml can do for your project, read the entire page above to be enlightened.</p>
<p>Enjoy self-serving these via your .asf.yaml file!</p>
