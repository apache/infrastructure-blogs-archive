<p>The Apache Logging team is pleased to announce the Apache log4j 2.0-beta4 release!</p>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the sixth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community</p>
<h3>New features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Log4j 2 to SLF4J adapter. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-131:  Add SMTPAppender. Thanks to Scott Severtson. </li>
<li>Added hostName and contextName to property map. </li>
<li>Add MessageFormatMessage and FormattedMessage. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-134:  Use %red, %white, %blue, and so on in the console appender. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-133:  Allow custom message creation via a message factory. </li>
<li>Added Flume Appender samples. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-156:  LocalizedMessageTest fails on linux system. Thanks to Andreas Born. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-152:  RollingFileAppender's FileRenameAction was throwing a NullPointerException if no directory was specified on the target file name. Thanks to Remko Popma. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-150:  Convert all System.getProperty calls to use PropertiesUtil to suppress SecurityExceptions. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-147:  ThreadContextMapFilter was matching on the key instead of the value of the key. Thanks to William Burns. </li>
<li>Allow FlumeAvroManager to initialize even if it cannot connect to an agent. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-149:  SMTPAppender will only cache filtered events. Thanks to Scott Severtson. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-145:  Add missing serial version IDs. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-144:  NullPointerException in RFC5424Layout. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-143:  MessagePatternConverter now returns "null" if the log message is null. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-142:  Serialized LogEvents were not reset in the output stream causing them to deserialize incorrectly. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-139:  Fix null pointer exception in SocketAppender if no protocol is specified. The protocol will default to TCP for the SocketAppender and UDP for the SyslogAppender. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-140:  Typo in documentation of SocketAppender. Thanks to Joern Huxhorn. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-137:  Fix hang in Dumbster SMTP test server. </li>

<li>LOG4J2-135:  BaseConfiguration does not close the first appender. Thanks to Ingo Feltes. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-132:  AbstractLogger.catching(Throwable) checks for DEBUG level but logs at ERROR level. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-129:  RoutingAppender was only creating a single appender for the default Route. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-126:  Allow JMS appenders to recover if the queue or topic is unavailable. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-127:  AbstractLogger methods were not passing Markers to the isEnabled methods. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-125:  JMSQueue and JMSTopic Appenders did not allow name to be specified. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-111:  Enhanced javadoc copyright statement. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-120:  TCPSocketManager would fail if the initial connection could not be established. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-119:  A broken socket connection would cause the TCPSocketManager to continuously reconnect. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-123:  The example for ThreadContextMapFilter was incorrect. Thanks to Olivier Lamy. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-116:  File renaming was using the wrong date value. Enhanced DefaultRolloverStrategy to store newest files in highest index as well as lowest. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-115:  ThreadContext Map elements with null values are now ignored when constructing a Flume event and in the RFC5424 Layout. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-113:  StructuredDataFilter createFilter was annotated with PluginAttr instead of PluginElement for the KeyValuePairs. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-114:  StructuredDataMessage was validating the length of the values in the event Map instead of the lengths of the keys. Thanks to Arkin Yetis. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-136:  Allow newlines to be escaped in Syslog and RFC5424 layouts. Allow Throwables to be included in the output from RFC5424Layout. Thanks to Scott Severtson. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-128:  Add follow attribute to Console Appender. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-122:  Add unit test to verify exceptions are thrown when the socket connection fails. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-110:  Renamed log4j12-api to log4j-1.2-api. </li>
</ul>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta4 requires a minimum of Java 5 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j12-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>

patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Apache Apache Log4j 2 website:</p>
