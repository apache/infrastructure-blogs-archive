Nick Mpallas writes in his Nick Says blog an entry titled <a href="http://nickermansays.blogspot.com/2009/07/openejb-31-jboss-embedded-and-ejb-30.html">OpenEJB 3.1 JBoss Embedded and EJB 3.0 unit testing</a> about his month long quest to figure out a way to unit test EJBs.  He tries JBoss Embedded first as so many people do and eventually settles on OpenEJB with TestNG and Hibernate.

Thanks for writing, Nick!  We're really excited to see more updates about your progress.
