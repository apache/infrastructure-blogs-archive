<p>We know we have projects that use reviewboard externally to the ASF, we also have some projects using codereview.appspot.com and we also have some projects using Fisheye/Clover externally.</p>
<p>Well, due to popular request, we now have an internal ReviewBoard running on https://reviews.apache.org !!</p>
<p>So, sign up for an account, request that your projects repository be added (file an INFRA issue) and get collaborating!</p>
<p>Questions or comments please raise them on the infrastructure-dev list as reviews.apache.org is in early stages it may need tweaking.</p>
