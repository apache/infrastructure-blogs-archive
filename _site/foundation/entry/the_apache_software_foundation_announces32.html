ApacheCon returns to Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, attracting Open Source users, developers, gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts to the newly-introduced &quot;Community Edition&quot; of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring an array of sessions focused on Apache projects and initiatives, plus MeetUps, FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. This is an ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open Source products and community practices. ApacheCon Europe Community Edition is organized and run by the Apache community; all content for ApacheCon has been selected by Apache Project Management Committees. 13 tracks explore key Open Source applications and issues, from Big Data and Smart Search to Cloud and Infrastructure, and include: Apache Daily &ndash;-the tools, frameworks, and components used on a daily basis, such as Apache Logging, Apache Maven, Apache Ant, Apache Buildr, Apache Commons, and more. ApacheEE &ndash;-all about Java Enterprise projects at the ASF, including Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache OpenEJB, Apache TomEE, Apache Tomcat, Apache MyFaces, Apache DeltaSpike, Apache BVal, and Apache OpenJPA.
