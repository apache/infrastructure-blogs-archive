  content: I applaud this move by the ASF and understand how difficult this must have
    been been for you. I fear that the whole Java community will suffer as a result
    of Oracle's now familiar stance with the open source community. Do you have any
    ideas where and what the ASF will do next in regards to this matter? How will
    the refusal of the TCK licence and the "whether you like it or not Java SE 7  is
    happening" stance affect how the various dependant project operate? Will there
    be a schism as there is with Illumos/OpenIndiana? I think we should look at this
    as a chance to make the right choices and move forward without the encumbrance
    of a mentality as Oracle has.

  content: "In the process of approving the purchase of Sun by Oracle, the European
    Commission took a lot of time to analyze the possible consequences for MySql.\r\n\r\nIf
    I am right, that kind of scrutiny was to performed in regards to Java but that
    does not mean you cannot do anything.\r\n\r\nDo you plan to appeal to the European
    Commission if (when) Oracle starts threatening Harmony and others? They have already
    sued Google and others will certainly follow. By all accounts, Oracle is trying
    to prevent the very same interoperability and openness the advocated for in the
    case of Microsoft, so IMHO they should be subject to the same obligations.\r\n"

    what Oracle is doing with Java let's as guess what's coming for MySQL. Time to
    move to postgresql, and keep the open source running. Microsoft as realized that
    the Open source community is here to stay and is slowly changing its ways, and
    becoming more community friendly, is sad to see Oracle  doing the exact opposite.
    ASF keep fighting for the open source community we are with you guys. WELL DONE.

  content: "Maybe Oracle has realized that Java is slowly heading towards passive
    existence. It has reached its peak, from here it's downwards, in which case it
    needs to be protected just for existence rather than growth.\r\n \r\nOracle is
    building a safe old age home for it, which is something Sun could not afford.\r\n\r\nLets
    hope ASF is able to convince it's members to contribute in projects like the experimental
    google go (golang), the amount of time spent re-writing the wheel (Harmony) would
    be better spent trying to create a fisrt in go. Contribute their Harmony ideas
    to the in dev real-time garbage collector for go.\r\n\r\nPS: The future is comming
    fast and unlike other VM's the JVM can not keep up. "

  content: By all means, I'm a huge fan of Apache...and I'm a bit afraid to say what's
    in my mind.  Let's take few steps back and few deep breaths... Java from Day 1
    has been "closed".  While many JSR has been released, Java was still "closed".  I
    don't think Sun was making much money from JDK.  Also, I always use Sun's Java
    JDK and never complained.  I never heard of Harmony until today but I do see the
    point Apache is trying to portray that Java is always Open.  But from Day 1, it
    has been closed.  Seriously, give credit to Sun for inventing Java and let them
    have the ownership to the JDK.  I am so grateful that Apache providing beautiful
    JSR implementations for free :).  You have so much room to roam free and run wild...
    Why are you keep knocking on the door who provided the tools necessary to build
    your environment?  I wish ASF would stayed longer w/ the JCP... if Oracle crosses
    boundary outside the JDK...then I'll condemn the oracle to hell... hahaha~ merry
    xmas!

  content: "I heard Oracle officials said usual \"Peace, dudes! Come back and let
    work together on technical things, screw all that politics\" and trying to make
    Apache look like childish geeks making fuss about nothing.\r\n\r\nI guess, Apache's
    words and publicity should stress points like \"Oracle failed to fulfill their
    contracts during a year now. They also failed to tell about their reasons to do
    so. They also failed to communicate to change their contract. Apache would not
    work through all their contract obligations when their partner does not make its
    part of contract in return. Oracle can not be treated reliable business partner
    and Apache cannot work with unreliable ones.\"\r\n\r\nIn official statements wording
    is to be corrected, but the sense is to remain. In unofficial leaks from non-top
    persons, the wording can be harsh. But the stress is not to be on \"unreliable
    Oracle can not fulfill its contract duties\"\r\n"

    of people. It is time for Oracle to finish the job and take Java fully private
    and to take on all the investment that the developer communities expect from a
    platform owner. Time to give back to the community that made Java grow, and to
    do it on your own. Good luck navigating the consumer app and services world. This
    is not the enterprise space boys. The only way to win the hearts, minds, investment,
    and code skills of the developer community is to show that how you will fill their
    wallets. Sun categorically failed at that, hopefully you are not listening to
    them. Good luck.

  content: "When JAVA first appeared, it reminded me of the failed attempts at running
    emulators on mainframes. A Virtual Machine is nothing more than an emulator -
    a P code generator/interpreter. I thought it was a bad idea and didn't buy into
    the \"write once - run anywhere\" mantra. \r\n\r\nThat was many years ago, and
    since then the VM has been the weak link all along. JAVA as a programming language
    is wonderful. Being forced to run it on a VM is the problem. Get rid of the VM.
    Keep the language, but compile the code and produce real object modules.\r\n\r\nFace
    it - there are only a few chip platforms around worth worrying about. Compile
    for them as necessary and get rid of that problematic VM.\r\n\r\n"

    back-peddle and realize the folly of their ways. Now Java will be to Oracle what
    .NET is to Microsoft and it will be the death of Java as we know it. Open source
    implementations of Java have helped it become one of the most widely used and
    most powerful languages available and now Oracle is throwing all this down the
    crapper because Mr. Ellison is a money grubbing, greedy person. Thanks Oracle,
    you have once again harmed the IT world with your selfish ways. I wonder how long
    it will be before MySQL becomes closed source or is scrapped all together to push
    people to buy Oracle... They've already screwed up Open Office, OpenSolaris, and
    open source implementation of ZFS. Just one more product to tack on the list...

    in the end Harmony might not be completely compatible with Oracle Java, is just
    a simple fact of life. This has happened with a lot of other programming languages
    as well. E.g. I am currently working with HP Pascal on OpenVMS. Not exactly Standard
    Pascal like Wirth developed. When inserting standard code, it just requires al
    little tweaking here and there. In case of the ASF projects, I would say: as long

  content: A huge earthquake in the opensource world. IMO Apache decision is the right
    one. I wait for Google move and let's see if I still invest time in Java as an
    opensource developer. What a shame!

  content: It's time for the community to make a new JVM-like technology based on
    the clean design elements of Java, and at the same time discard all the shortcomings!
    Cut the JRE to under 5MB! Redesign Swing! Get rid of Cloneable and Serializable!

    so rely both on Java and Apache? What is the way forward? I wonder what RMS thinks
    about this [probably an I told you so]?

  content: Good, the JCP was an awful idea from its inception, the idea that open
    source has to be governed by an external "expert committee" often sworn to secrecy
    ran counter to the idea of a transparent Meritocracy from the beginning.   It
    is about time.

<p>The Apache<br />
Software Foundation has <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-community/201012.mbox/%3C64C623FF-90E7-48C0-A371-C53B848CB4DE@pobox.com%3E">resigned its seat</a> on the Java SE/EE Executive<br />
Committee.&nbsp; Apache has served on the EC for the past 10 years, winning<br />
the JCP "Member of the Year" award 4 times, and recently was ratified<br />
for another term with support from 95% of the voting community.&nbsp;<br />
Further, the project communities of the ASF, home to Apache Tomcat, Ant,<br />
 Xerces, Geronimo, Velocity and nearly a 100 mainstay java components<br />
have implemented countless JSRs and serve on and contribute to many of<br />
the JCPs technical expert groups.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We'd like to provide some explanation to the community as to why we're taking this significant step.</p>
<p>The<br />
 recent Java SE 7 vote was the last chance for the JCP EC to demonstrate<br />
 that the EC has any intent to defend the JCP as an open specification<br />
process, and demonstrate that the letter and spirit of the law<br />
matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the issues at stake in the vote, we believe that<br />
while continuing to fail to uphold their responsibilities under the<br />
JSPA, Oracle provided the EC with a Java SE 7 specification request and<br />
license that are self-contradictory, severely restrict distribution of<br />
independent implementations of the spec, and most importantly, prohibit<br />
the distribution of independent open source implementations of the<br />
spec.&nbsp; Oracle has refused to answer any reasonable and responsible<br />
questions from the EC regarding these problems.</p>
<p>In the phrase<br />
"fail to uphold their responsibilities under the JSPA", we are referring<br />
 to Oracle's refusal to provide the ASF's Harmony project with a TCK<br />
license for Java SE that complies with Oracle's obligations under the<br />
JSPA as well as public promises made to the Java community by officers<br />
of Sun Microsystems (recently acquired by Oracle.)&nbsp; This breach of the<br />
JSPA was begun by Sun Microsystems in August of 2006 and is a policy<br />
that Oracle explicitly continues today.&nbsp; For more information on this<br />
dispute, see our <a href="http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html">open letter to Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>
<p>This<br />
vote was the only real power the Executive Committee has as the<br />
governing body of the Java specification ecosystem, and as we <a href="http://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/statement_by_the_asf_board1">indicated<br />
previously</a> we were looking for the EC to protect the rights of<br />
implementers to the degree they are able, as well as preserve the<br />
integrity of the JCP licensing structure by ensuring that JCP<br />
specifications are able to be freely implemented and distributed.&nbsp; We<br />
don't believe this is an unreasonable position - it should be noted that<br />
 the majority of the EC members, including Oracle, have publicly stated<br />
that restrictions on distribution such as those found in the Java SE 7<br />
license have no place in the JCP - and two distinguished individual<br />
members of the EC, <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html">Doug Lea</a> and <a href="http://tembrel.blogspot.com/2010/12/resigned-from-ec.html">Tim Peierls</a>, both have resigned in<br />
protest over the same issue.</p>
<p>By approving Java SE 7, the<br />
EC has failed on both counts : the members of the EC refused to stand up<br />
 for the rights of implementers, and by accepting Oracle's TCK license<br />
terms for Java SE 7, they let the integrity of the JCP's licensing<br />
structure be broken.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation concludes<br />
that that JCP is not an open specification process - that Java<br />
specifications are proprietary technology that must be licensed directly<br />
 from the spec lead under whatever terms the spec lead chooses; that the<br />
 commercial concerns of a single entity, Oracle, will continue to<br />
seriously interfere with and bias the transparent governance of the<br />
ecosystem;&nbsp; that it is impossible to distribute independent<br />
implementations of JSRs under open source licenses such that users are<br />
protected from IP litigation by expert group members or the spec lead;<br />
and finally, the EC is unwilling or unable to assert the basic power of<br />
their role in the JCP governance process.</p>
<p>In short, the EC and the Java Community Process are neither.</p>
<p>To<br />
 that end, our representative has informed the JCP's Program Management<br />
Office of our resignation, effective immediately.&nbsp; As such, the ASF is<br />
removing all official representatives from any and all JSRs. In<br />
addition, we will refuse any renewal of our JCP membership and, of<br />
course, our EC position.</p>
