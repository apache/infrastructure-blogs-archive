  1.0.0 release!\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nApache Log4j Audit provides a framework for defining
  audit events and then logging them using Log4j. The framework focuses on defining
  the events and providing an easy mechanism for applications to log them, allowing
  products to provide consistency and validity to the events that are logged. It does
  not focus on how the log events are written to a data store. Log4j itself provides
  many options for that.\r\nLog4j Audit builds upon Log4j by defining its own AuditMessage.
  An AuditMessage is a container for structured data messages which allows a log message
  to be generated that contains a set of keys and values. The AuditMessage passes
  through Log4j as any other log event would.\r\n</p>\r\n"

The Apache Log4j  team is pleased to announce the Apache Log4j Audit 1.0.0 release!</p>
<p>
Apache Log4j Audit provides a framework for defining audit events and then logging them using Log4j. The framework focuses on defining the events and providing an easy mechanism for applications to log them, allowing products to provide consistency and validity to the events that are logged. It does not focus on how the log events are written to a data store. Log4j itself provides many options for that.<br />
Log4j Audit builds upon Log4j by defining its own AuditMessage. An AuditMessage is a container for structured data messages which allows a log message to be generated that contains a set of keys and values. The AuditMessage passes through Log4j as any other log event would.</p>
