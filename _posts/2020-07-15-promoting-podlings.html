<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The Infrastructure<br />
team is constantly looking for ways to do its work more quickly while<br />
maintaining the ASF standards of reliability, security, and<br />
almost-continuous availability. The more the team can speed up and<br />
improve standard processes that almost every project goes through,<br />
the better it is for the whole community.<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp; &nbsp;As an example,<br />
when a project starts out with the ASF, it normally begins as a<br />
&ldquo;podling&rdquo; in the ASF incubator. Here it can start to create its<br />
code, standard practices, and work methods in a development sandbox.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp; &nbsp;Once the project<br />
develops a large-enough community of committers and contributors, and<br />
seems to be viable, it can request promotion to top-level-project<br />
(TLP) status. This is a great moment for the project and for the ASF,<br />
but it also used to involve a considerable amount of work for Infra.<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp; &nbsp;Infra Administrator<br />
Greg Stein recalls that, at the beginning, the promotion &ldquo;process&rdquo;<br />
was no more than a checklist of about thirty &ldquo;fiddly steps&rdquo;, each<br />
of which required someone to do one or several manual tasks during<br />
which any number of things could go wrong. It was considered great<br />
progress when the checklist reduced to twenty manual steps.<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp; &nbsp;Significant<br />
improvements included simplifications of tasks related to mailing<br />
lists in 2010 and LDAP simplifications in 2016, but even as recently<br />
as 2017 the promotion process involved an Infra team member&rsquo;s<br />
engagement in many steps over the course of two or three hours. This<br />
is what each component required for the promotion of Apache Ranger<br />
that year:<br></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Between then and now<br />
the team has improved automation of the various steps, especially<br />
with the introduction of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/git+-+.asf.yaml+features" target="_blank">asf.yaml</a>&nbsp;configuration files to simplify publishing project websites. In<br />
2020 the same promotion process, for Apache ShardingSphere, took a<br />
grand total of <b>four minutes</b>:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/53eb7318-305c-4ace-831e-c0bfd6a679b4"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/mediaresource/53eb7318-305c-4ace-831e-c0bfd6a679b4?t=true" alt="promote2020.png" style="width: 25%;"></a><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Infra member Daniel<br />
Gruno says, &ldquo;The majority of the work is just a click of a button<br />
by the ASF secretary nowadays, and then the few remaining bits can<br />
take between five and sixty minutes to complete.&rdquo; That range<br />
reflects the fact that no two projects have the same profile, system<br />
requirements, and performance expectations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&nbsp; &nbsp;These improvements<br />
in the podling promotion process are a good reminder of how important<br />
it can be to take the time to &ldquo;sharpen the saw.&rdquo;</p>
