Hi all,

<br><br>
This project has a tradition of rotating the PMC Chair about every 2 years,
to ensure continuity while at the same time preventing potential
contributor burn-out.
<br><br>

Recently the PMC has undertaken the necessary actions for this and has
found contributor (and PMC Member) <em>Shawn McKinney</em> willing and ready to take
the gavel from <em>Stefan Seelmann</em> to head our great project, and the Board of
the ASF has, in their meeting on Jan 16th 2019 (see [1], ratified the
rotation.
<br><br>
Please join me in thanking <em>Stefan Seelmann</em> for heading the project in 2017
and 2018 and welcoming <em>Shawn McKinney</em> as the new PMC Chair and Vice
President of the Apache Directory project.
<br><br>
