It's amazing to see the Apache Flex community alive and kicking at  <a href="http://www.360flex.com" target="_blank">360 Flex 2012</a>. 

Thanks to Mr. Wilker himself, we have our own room in Lone Tree: The Apache Flex Discovery Room. Come by the room and find out about Apache Flex, figure out how you can be a part of our growing community, or just stop by to get some help. By the way, if you're just getting started Justin Mclean has offered to show you how to download and build the SDK. Just find him in the room and say hello.

Also, there's plenty of committers here and a number of activities going on throughout the week.
