<p><span style="font-stretch: normal;">The ASF Infrastructure team is happy to announce that projects can how have AppVeyor CI setup on their GitHub mirrors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The only thing you need to do is create an INFRA ticket at <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA/">issues.apache.org</a> with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repo Name</li>
<li>Mailing list to send build notifications to (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already a few projects using AppVeyor on their GitHub mirror, and we now have an Organization role account for central management (and I have gone through an updated previous tickets with new links to badges).</p></p>
<p>If you have any questions, you can ask us in <a href="http://infra.chat/">Hipchat</a> or you can email infrastructure@apache.org</p></p>
