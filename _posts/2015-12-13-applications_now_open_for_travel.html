<p>The Apache Software Foundation's Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) have announced that applications for travel assistance to ApacheCon North America 2016 are now open.</p>
<p>ApacheCon North America will take place 9-13 May 2016 in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada. </p>
<p>This year's ApacheCon is split into two separate themed events:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Apache:Big Data --the Apache projects and people working in Big Data, ubiquitous computing, data engineering, and science<br />&nbsp;- ApacheCon:Core --the technologies, projects, and communities driving the future of Open Source, ubiquitious and emerging Web solutions, and Cloud computing</p>
<p>Event details and are available at <a href="http://apachecon.com/">http://apachecon.com/</a>&nbsp;; the Calls for Participation for both events are also open.</p>
<p>Important:&nbsp;due to the short timeframe of each event, only applications from those who are able to attend BOTH events will be considered. Applications close on 2 March 2, 2016. Please ensure your application contains as much supporting material as required to efficiently and accurately process your request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TAC exists to help those that would like to attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons. For more information, and to apply, please visit <a href="http://www.apache.org/travel/">http://www.apache.org/travel/</a>&nbsp;As with previous years, the TAC team anticipates a high volume of applications from a diverse range of backgrounds, and therefore encourage those considering to submit an application to do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you in Vancouver!</p>
<p>-Sally Khudairi, on behalf of the TAC team</p>
