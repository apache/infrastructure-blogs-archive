<meta name="description" content="Good news! &nbsp; We&#39;ve finally laid the necessary groundwork to extend the bypassing of committer emails sent from their apache.org addresses, from commit lists to now all Apache mailing lists. &nbsp;This feature was activated earlier today and represents a significant benefit for cross-collaboration between Apache mailing lists for committers, relieving moderators of needless burden. Also we&#39;d like to remind you of the SSL-enabled SMTP submission service we offer committers listening on people.apache.org port 465. &nbsp;Gmail users in particular can enjoy a convenient way of sending email, to any recipient even outside apache.org, using their apache.org committer address. &nbsp;For more on that please see our website&#39;s documentation. To complement these features we&#39;d also like to remind committers of the ability to request an &quot;owner file&quot; be added to their email forwarder by filing an appropriate INFRA jira ticket. &nbsp;Owner files alleviate most of the problems associated with outside organizations, who may be running strict SPF policies, attempting to reach you at your apache.org address. &nbsp;Without an owner file those messages will typically bounce back to those organizations instead of successfully reaching you at your target forwarding address. &nbsp;For those familiar with SRS, this is a poor-man&#39;s version of that specification&#39;s feature set. &nbsp;Please direct your detailed questions about owner files to the infrastructure-dev@apache.org mailing list. NOTE: we&#39;ve extended this bypass feature to include any committer email addresses listed in their personal LDAP record with Apache." />
