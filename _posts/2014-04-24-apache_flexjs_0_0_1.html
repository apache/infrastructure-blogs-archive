excerpt: "The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the initial (alpha) release
  of Apache FlexJS SDK 0.0.1 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.0.1.\r\n\r\nApache
  Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for building and
  maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently on all major browsers,
  desktops and devices (including smartphones,\r\ntablets and tv).\r\n\r\nApache FlexJS
  is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript
  to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the same MXML and ActionScript to
  HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively in browsers.  The cross-compiled code
  can also be used in Apache Cordova (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.\r\n\r\nApache
  Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript cross-compiler.  It extends
  the next-generation SWF compiler known as Falcon.  Both are contained in the release
  package and are used by the FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS."

    guys!\r\n\r\nQuestion: \r\nI see, that the next generation of compiling a \"MXML/AS3
    Project\" will be Falcon. \r\nThe compiled output JS classes also can be used
    by \"Apache Cordova/PhoneGap\" to build native applications for mobile devices.
    \r\nPhoneGap has to be build with the Cordova/PhoneGap Build web service.\r\nNow
    I can package my own app, but in the future with Falcon, this can't be done by
    the end-user?"

    who has contributed huge amount of time to re-run Flex.\r\nThanks once again.\r\nBut
    from my point view, we need some tool who can easily integrate with oracle weblogic,
    create some BPM project, for Telecom and finance domains. Yes, it is existing
    in Oracle, like Metasolv etc. So we need to think that type of thing also for
    integration front end to db. and with Flexjs we can able to run that apps from
    any device. these are the + points for us. :)\r\nAfter all, congrats guys.. keep
    it up.. \r\n:)\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nMadhusudan"

<p>The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the initial (alpha) release of Apache FlexJS SDK 0.0.1 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.0.1.</p>
<p>Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones,<br />
tablets and tv).</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively in browsers.  The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.</p>
<p>Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript cross-compiler.  It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as Falcon.  Both are contained in the release package and are used by the FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS.</p>
<p>This is the initial release of FlexJS and FalconJX.  It is 'alpha' quality.  The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest productivity developing applications that can run in the most places. These releases may not handle production needs.  Expect lots of bugs and missing features.  Please file bugs at:</p>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/</a></p>
<p>For questions about how to use FlexJS and FalconJX, send email to users@flex.apache.org.  Please try to prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX] so it is clear the questions refer to this release and not the Flex SDK and MXMLC compiler.</p>
<p>For questions and feedback on the development of the source code in these releases, send email to dev@flex.apache.org.  Again, please prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX].</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX are available in source and binary form from the following download page:</p>
<p><a href="http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html">http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html</a></p>
<p>When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the downloads using signatures or MD5 hashes.</p>
<p>A simple way to try these releases is to use a pre-release of the InstallApacheFlex 3.0 application which is available at the following url:</p>
<p><a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/flex/installer/3.0/rc7/binaries/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/flex/installer/3.0/rc7/binaries/</a></p>
<p>Choose Apache FlexJS 0.0.1 and it will create an Adobe Flash Builder-compatible SDK that uses the Falcon and FalconJX compilers to generate SWFs and HTML/JS/CSS output.  See the README or the FlexJS wiki<br />
for more information.  The FlexJS section of the wiki is at the following url:</p>
