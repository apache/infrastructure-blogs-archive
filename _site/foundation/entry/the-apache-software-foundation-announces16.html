Apache Polygene is a Java application framework used for persistence-centric applications. Polygene delivers a comprehensive solution for creating business applications, with dependency injection, aspect oriented programming, persistence system, metrics and serialization, in a modular fashion with dozens of extensions. &quot;Apache Polygene&#39;s slogan --&#39;New Energy for Java - Classes are Dead, Long Live Interfaces&#39; -- truly captures what Apache Polygene is really about: designing software efficiently,&quot; said Niclas Hedhman, original project co-founder and member of the Apache Polygene Project Management Committee. &quot;Too many frameworks add a lot of boilerplate and configuration that is simply not needed.

Further details are available in the Apache Polygene 3.0 technical fact sheet https://blogs.apache.org/polygene/date/20170730 &quot;Version 3.0 has been more work than any previous release,&quot; said Paul Merlin, Vice President of and Release Manager of Apache Polygene. &quot;We have rewritten large sections of the Polygene Runtime to leverage Java 8 platform, and decided to minimize user impact by making all other changes that may break compatibility with previous versions at the same time.&quot; &quot;In our new business venture, I am again happy to use Polygene to simplify the application modeling,&quot; said Jiri Jetmar, member of the Apache Polygene Project Management Committee and longtime Polygene user. &quot;Many features are crucial, but being able to not use JPA and have a better persistence model is probably the most important one for us. There are very few alternatives to JPA, and Polygene is simply the best.&quot; Polygene originated in 2007 as Qi4j, and, in 2015, became the first project to enter the ASF as a pTLP (provisional Top-Level Project) without entering the Apache Incubator. The project celebrated its 10 year anniversary with its 9th supported release, and is planning for 3 additional releases in the next 12 months. &quot;We are already working on Polygene 3.1 with a code generator to get started more quickly,&quot; added Hedhman. &quot;Also in the works is an enterprise-friendly SQL entity store, to remove the last objections of using Polygene in enterprise projects.&quot; &quot;Moving forward, we are determined to preserve compatibility,&quot; added Merlin. &quot;We invite interested individuals to download Polygene and join the discussion on future features and enhancements.&quot; Availability and Oversight Apache Polygene software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.
