    <p><b><i>World's first schema-free SQL query engine brings self-service data exploration to Apache Hadoop&trade;</i></b></p>
<p><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;02 December 2014&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 200 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&trade; Drill&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apache Drill is the world's first schema-free SQL query engine that delivers real-time insights by removing the constraint of building and maintaining schemas before data can be analyzed. Drill users can run interactive ANSI SQL queries on complex or constantly evolving data including JSON, Parquet, and HBase without ever worrying about schema definitions. As a result, Drill not only enables rapid application development on Apache Hadoop&trade; but also allows enterprise BI analysts to access Hadoop in a self-service fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Apache Drill's graduation is a testament to the maturity of the technology and a strong indicator of the active community that develops and supports it," said Jacques Nadeau, Vice President of Apache Drill. "Drill's vibrant community ensures that it will continue to evolve to meet the demands of self-service data exploration use cases."&nbsp;</p>
<p>While providing faster time to value from data stored in Hadoop, Drill also reduces the burden on IT developers and administrators who prepare and maintain datasets for analysis. Analysts can explore data in real-time, pull in new datasets on the fly, and also use traditional BI tools to visualize the data easily &ndash; all by themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by Google's Dremel (an academic paper on interactive analysis of Web-scale datasets), and a vision to support modern big data applications, Drill entered the Apache Incubator in August 2012. The project currently has code contributions from individual committers representing MapR, Hortonworks, Pentaho, and Cisco, among others.&nbsp;</p>
