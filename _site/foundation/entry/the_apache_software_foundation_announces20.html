Apache Geronimo v3.0-beta-1 joins the Java EE 6 Reference Implementation as the only Open Source application server to be compatible with both Full and Web Profiles support. &quot;We&#39;re very happy to announce this significant milestone for the project,&quot; said Kevan Miller, Vice President of Apache Geronimo. &quot;In addition to the Java EE 6 capabilities we&#39;ve added to the product, Geronimo is now restructured to run on an OSGi kernel.

OSGi technologies which are contained within Apache Geronimo include: Apache Aries, Apache Felix, and Apache Karaf. This wide array of Apache projects illustrates the breadth and depth of the software solutions developed at the Apache Software Foundation. &quot;Our move to OSGi has represented a signficant amount of internal restructuring, but this restructuring leaves us well positioned for future developments,&quot; explained Miller. &quot;The Apache Aries, Apache Karaf, and Apache Felix projects have provided us a great base for our Geronimo 3.0 OSGi enhancments.
