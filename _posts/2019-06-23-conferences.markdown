<div>Some ApacheCon sponsors and members of the greater Apache community have reported that they have been contacted by a company called Global Expo Travel that is alleging to be affiliated with ApacheCon.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>They are claiming to be &quot;handling the travel&quot; for ApacheCon North America.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>This statement is 100% false. We do not know anyone at Global Expo Travel and have not contracted this company to conduct any business on behalf of ApacheCon or The Apache Software Foundation in any capacity.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>We will not tolerate spoofing or related fraudulent activity in any form.</div>
