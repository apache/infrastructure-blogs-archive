<div>When the ASF incorporated in 1999, the Foundation's core membership comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group grew with Committers --developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>to "commit" or "write" (contribute) directly to the code repository;
</li>
<li>the right to vote on community-related decisions; and
</li>
<li>the ability propose an active user for Committership.</li>
</ol></div>
<div></div>
<div>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation&rsquo;s growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing members.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This election brings the total number of ASF Members to 684 today. Individuals elected as ASF Members legally serve as the "shareholders" of the Foundation <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html">https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html</a></div>
