<div><b><i>Open Source distributed database management system simplifies Big Data application development with new features, performance optimizations, and significant storage savings</i></b></div> 
  <div><b><br /></b></div> 
  <div><b>Forest Hill, MD —10 November 2015—</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache™ Cassandra™ v3.0, the Open Source distributed database management system.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>Designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, Apache Cassandra provides high availability with no single point of failure. v3.0 is a new milestone in the database's evolution with performance optimizations, improved data consistency operations, an average of 50% data storage savings, and numerous important developer enhancements, such as new materialized views, that greatly simplify application development.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;It's exciting to break new ground with the materialized views in Cassandra 3.0,&quot; said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra. &quot;Open source at Apache is clearly the leading source of innovation in the Big Data space today.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Cassandra 3.0 represents a significant shift in both plumbing and usability,&quot; said Robbie Strickland, Director of Software Engineering at The Weather Channel. &quot;A CQL-centric storage model and the advent of materialized views should dramatically reduce the learning curve and help increase its utility for a wider range of use cases.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Materialized Views in Cassandra 3.0 continues the CQL tradition of adding new features that improve usability,&quot; said Aaron Morton, founder at Big Data consultancy The Last Pickle. &quot;By supporting a common use pattern as a first class entity in the database, developers of all levels will find it easier to deliver great products.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;With each version Cassandra has consistently raised the bar on distributed database scalability and performance,&quot; said Russell Bradberry, founder at content analytics company SimpleReach. &quot;Version 3.0 does all this and adds an amazing feature set. &nbsp;Materialized views and User Defined Aggregates will allow SimpleReach to move a large portion of data manipulation logic to where the data lives. We anticipate a dramatic increase in performance and reliability across the board.&quot;</div>
