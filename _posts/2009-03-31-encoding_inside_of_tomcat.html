<p>Something to be aware of when switching the encoding to UTF-8 is that tomcat will need to be reconfigured also. The encoding of URL-parameters (for GET-requests) is still&nbsp; interpreted as ISO-8859-1. You may want to set useBodyEncodingForURI="true" in the connector in use. See <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html">http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html</a> on what this does.</p>
