<p>The Apache Logging team is pleased to announce the Apache log4j 2.0-beta4 release!</p>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the sixth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community</p>

</ul>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta4 requires a minimum of Java 5 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j12-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
