  content: "As a home user I don't have the means to attend or contribute a paper
    etc.\r\n\r\nI mainly use Calc, Writer & Base. Recently I have found Base to be
    very useful, particularly the report writer. I have however found some difficulties
    with Base, partly because it is new to me, but I do feel that the documentation
    for Base & its report writer could be expanded & improved. If it would be of any
    help I could report on problems encountered as they occur.\r\n\r\nI have found
    that Base is particularly useful in fillling gaps in Calc such as the ability
    to create group totals & summaries.\r\n\r\nJRvZ\r\n"

  content: "Hi,\r\nI'm a sprightly 73 year old. I'm intrigued as to why people choose
    to pay for Microsoft office \"because others are using it\" rather than use the
    free Open office and go to the minute effort of converting.\r\nThis could make
    for an interesting exploration. All the best with your conference\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\nTim"

  content: 'I used openoffice 5 years and was pleased with it. As the last version
    (3.4) makes me not be able to use my files, I used the forum to know what I did
    wrong and how to solve it. I fooowed all helpers offered me to do and did not
    fix my problem. Then I changed product to another and it works without any problems
    now. '

    \"because others are using it\" rather than use the free Open office and go to
    the minute effort of converting. \r\nThere is an excellent piece at http://www.idealware.org/articles/msoffice_vs_openoffice.php
    \   That is a precise of the tech difference of MS and other software and also
    goes into why people make decisions based more on tech spec.\r\n\r\n"

  content: "I wish like to comment on the difficulty of installing OO on a Fedora
    machine. \r\nBy default, Libre Office is installed with Fedora 16 and 17 and possibly
    earlier versions as well. I was unable to install OO3.4 without removing Libre
    Office. Once Libre Office was finally un-installed, in itself, not an easy task,
    I found that 50% of my Gnome 3 desktop had gone and logging in was not possible
    from the graphical interface.\r\nOO3.4 installed and ran perfectly but without
    the functionality of the Gnome 3 desktop.\r\nAn upgrade to Fedora 17 re-installed
    Libre Office!\r\n\r\nContrast this with the ease of installing on Mac OSX and
    Windows, both of which I use.\r\nNormally, one would expect the difficulties with
    Windows machines, not Linux."

  content: "I recently discovered a solution to an old problem using openoffice.\r\nAt
    one time I used a canon Starwriter 95 which went u/s trapping a lot of data on
    discettes. Canon no longer provided support for the system but suggested a firm
    who would sell me an expensive programme to solve the problem. Recently I tried
    to open them with OpenOffice\r\nIt worked - a little loss of format.  Big thank
    you. \r\n"

  content: yo peeps of open office, for one, it's nice to know that it's opens ms-office
    and google docs. however I find the base interface hard to use as a form seems
    almost exactly like writer, was hoping for a window form or at very least something
    more internal than say a writer. some help docs would be of great help. Thanks
    a bunch.

<p>The ApacheCon Europe 2012 team has opened the <a href="http://s.apache.org/mx">Call for Papers</a>. Deadline for submission is August 13th. This year the conference will be held in Sinsheim, Germany from November 5 - 9. Check out the conference site here: http://www.apachecon.eu/</p>
<p>The Apache OpenOffice project team is planning to build a dedicated stream of sessions. Think of this as a "Conference-Within-a-Conference" where we will focus on everything related to Apache OpenOffice. </p>
<p>We invite you to submit proposals for talks, for technical sessions focused on the core components: Writer, Calc, Impress, Math, Base and Draw. Equally important topics include: Programmability, Extensions, User Experience Design, Performance, Quality Engineering, Translation, Support, Website, Documentation and Community.</p>
<p>If your experience and expertise falls more in the business side of things, please submit proposals for sessions where you can share experiences deploying Apache OpenOffice. Case studies for Apache OpenOffice adoption in government, industry and educational environments are most welcome.</p>
<p>In addition to the formal talks, there will be hackathon rooms, meetups and evening sessions. </p>
<p>For more background information please have a look at our <a href="http://s.apache.org/4cp">project planning wiki</a>. The plan will evolve and depend on everyone contributing and bringing the best of their knowledge and expertise to ApacheCon Europe. </p>
<p>You are cordially invited to <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu/cfp/">submit a proposal</a> for a talk. Community is our strength. This is your opportunity to share and shine.</p>
