<p>In addition, ASF Members Eric Pugh and Jason van Zyl have been reinstated from emeritus status.</p>
<p>The ASF incorporated in 1999 with a core membership of 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group grew with Committers &mdash;developers who contributed code, patches, documentation, and other contributions, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership:</p>
<ul>
<li>to "commit" or "write" directly to Apache code repositories as well as make non-code contributions;</li>
<li>the right to vote on community-related decisions; and</li>
<li>the ability to propose an active contributor for Committership.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation's growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing Members.<br></p>
<p>This election brings the total number of active ASF Members to 918 today. Individuals elected as ASF Members legally serve as the "shareholders" of the Foundation <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html" target="_blank">https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html</a><a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
