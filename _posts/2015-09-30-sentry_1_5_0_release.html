<h2 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apache Sentry 1.5.1-Incubating released!</h2>
<div></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">On July 16, the Apache Sentry community announced the release of Apache Sentry 1.5.1-incubating. Significant work has gone into this release which includes 8 major features, 18 improvements and 131 defects fixes.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The following are the important features in this release:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. Column-level access control: This feature provides the access control on column level support for the component such as HIVE. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. More granular privileges to the DBModel: This feature adds more privilege types like CREATE, DROP, INDEX, LOCK etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3. High availability for Sentry service: Provide the option of running more redundant Sentry instances in the same cluster with a hot standby. This allows a fast failover to a new Sentry instance seamlessly in the case of outages.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. Solr Sentry plug-in integration with DB store: Solr can persist the security policies into a database store like the hive plugin does. This new feature leverages the generic authorization model framework (which is also one new feature added in this release).</div>
