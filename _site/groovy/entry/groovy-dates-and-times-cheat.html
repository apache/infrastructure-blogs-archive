<meta name="description" content="Java has had a Date class from the very beginning and Groovy supports using it and several related classes like Calendar. Throughout this blog post we refer to those classes as the legacy date classes. Groovy enhances the experience of using the legacy date classes with simpler mechanisms for formatting, parsing and extracting fields from the related classes. Since Java 8, the JDK has included the JSR-310 Date Time API. We refer to these classes as the new date classes. The new date classes remove many limitations of the legacy date classes and bring some greatly appreciated additional consistency. Groovy provides similar enhancements for the new date classes too. Groovy&#39;s enhancements for the legacy date classes are in the groovy-dateutil module (prior to Groovy 2.5, this functionality was built in to the core module). The groovy-datetime module has the enhancements for the new date classes. You can include a dependency to this module in your build file or reference the groovy-all pom dependency. Both modules are part of a standard Groovy install. The next few sections illustrate common date and time tasks and the code to perform them using the new and legacy classes with Groovy enhancements in numerous places. Please note: that some of the formatting commands are Locale dependent and the output may vary slightly if you run these examples yourself. Representing the current date/time The legacy date classes have an abstraction which includes date and time. If you are only interested in one of those two aspects, you simply ignore the other aspect. The new date classes allow you to have date-only, time-only and date-time representations. The examples create instances representing the current date and/or time. Various information is extracted from the instances and they are printed in various ways. Some of the examples use the SV macro which prints the name and string value of one or more variables. task java.time legacy current date and time println LocalDateTime.now() println Instant.now() 2022-10-24T12:40:02.218130200 2022-10-24T02:40:02.223131Z println new Date() println Calendar.instance.time Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 day of current year &amp;day of current month println LocalDateTime.now().dayOfYearprintln LocalDateTime.now().dayOfMonth 297 24 println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_YEAR]println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_MONTH] 297 24 extract today&#39;syear, month &amp; day var now = LocalDate.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.year, now.monthValue, now.dayOfMonth)(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y $M $D&quot; now.year=2022, now.monthValue=10, now.dayOfMonth=24 Today is 2022 10 24 var now = Calendar.instance(_E, Y, M, _WY, _WM, D) = nowprintln &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot;(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot; Today is 2022 10 24 Today is 2022 10 24 alternatives to print today println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 extract parts of current time now = LocalTime.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.hour, now.minute, now.second)(H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE_OF_HOUR, SECOND_OF_MINUTE]printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n&#39;, H, M, S now.hour=12, now.minute=40, now.second=2 The time is 12:40:02 (H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE, SECOND] println SV(H, M, S) printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d%n&#39;, H, M, S H=12, M=40, S=2 The time is 12:40:02 alternatives to print time println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 Processing times The new date classes have a LocalTime class specifically for representing time-only quantities. The legacy date classes don&#39;t have such a purpose-built abstraction; you essentially just ignore the day, month, and year parts of a date. The java.sql.Time class could be used as an alterative but rarely is.&nbsp;The Java documentation comparing the new date classes to their legacy equivalents, talks about using GregorianCalendar with the date set to the epoch value of 1970-01-01 as an approximation of the LocalTime class. We&#39;ll follow that approach here to provide a comparison but we strongly recommend upgrading to the new classes if you need to represent time-only values or use the Joda-Time library on JDK versions prior to 8. &lt;/p&gt; The examples look at representing a minute before and after midnight, and some times at which you might eat your meals. For the meals, as well as printing various values, we might be interested in calculating new times in terms of existing times, e.g. lunch and dinner are 7 hours apart. task java.time legacy one min after midnight LocalTime.of(0, 1).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(MINUTE, 1) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am one min before midnight LocalTime.of(23, 59).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(hourOfDay: 23, minute: 59) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm meal times var breakfast = LocalTime.of(7, 30)var lunch = LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30&#39;)assert lunch == LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30.00 pm&#39;, &#39;hh:mm.ss a&#39;)lunch.with { assert hour == 12 &amp;&amp; minute == 30 }var dinner = lunch.plusHours(7)assert dinner == lunch.plus(7, ChronoUnit.HOURS)assert Duration.between(lunch, dinner).toHours() == 7assert breakfast.isBefore(lunch) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthandassert lunch in breakfast..dinnerassert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.format(FormatStyle.MEDIUM) == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert dinner.timeString == &#39;19:30:00&#39; var breakfast = Date.parse(&#39;hh:mm&#39;, &#39;07:30&#39;)var lunch = Calendar.instance.tap { clear() set(hourOfDay: 12, minute: 30)}assert lunch[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE] == [12, 30]var dinner = lunch.clone().tap { it[HOUR_OF_DAY] += 7 }assert dinner == lunch.copyWith(hourOfDay: 19)assert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.time.timeString == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert breakfast.before(lunch.time) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthand Processing dates To represent date-only information with the legacy date classes, you set the time aspects to zero, or simply ignore them. Alternatively, you could consider the less commonly used&nbsp;java.sql.Date&nbsp;class. The new date classes have the special LocalDate class for this purpose which we highly recommend. The examples create dates for Halloween and Melbourne Cup day (a public holiday in the Australia state of Victoria). We look at various properties of those two dates. task java.time legacy holidays var halloween22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 10, 31)var halloween23 = LocalDate.parse(&#39;2023-Oct-31&#39;, &#39;yyyy-LLL-dd&#39;)assert halloween22 == halloween23 - 365assert halloween23 == halloween22.plusYears(1)var melbourneCup22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 11, 1)assert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert Period.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22).days == 1assert ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22) == 1Lvar days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) {days &lt;&lt; &quot;$it.dayOfWeek&quot; }assert days == [&#39;MONDAY&#39;, &#39;TUESDAY&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 var halloween21 = Date.parse(&#39;dd/MM/yyyy&#39;, &#39;31/10/2021&#39;)var halloween22 = Date.parse(&#39;yyyy-MMM-dd&#39;, &#39;2022-Oct-31&#39;)assert halloween21 + 365 == halloween22var melbourneCup22 = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1).timeassert melbourneCup22.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // AU Localeassert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert melbourneCup22 == halloween22.copyWith(month: 10, date: 1)var days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) { days &lt;&lt; it.format(&#39;EEEEE&#39;) }assert days == [&#39;Monday&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 Processing date and time combinations The new date classes use LocalDateTime to represent a quantity with both date and time aspects. Many of the methods seen earlier will also be applicable here. The examples show creating and printing a representation of lunch on Melbourne Cup day. task java.time legacy holidays var melbourneCupLunch = LocalDateTime.of(2022, 11, 1, 12, 30)assert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;2022-11-01&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;2022-11-01T12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalDate() == melbourneCup22assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalTime() == lunchassert melbourneCupLunch == melbourneCup22 &lt;&lt; lunch var melbourneCupLunch = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1, 12, 30).timeassert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;1/11/22, 12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.clearTime() == melbourneCup22 Processing zoned date and times The legacy date classes have the concept of a TimeZone, predominantly used by the Calendar class. The new date classes has a similar concept but uses the ZoneId, ZoneOffset, and ZonedDateTime classes (among others). The examples show various properties of zones and show that during the Melbourne cup breakfast, it would still be the night before (Halloween) in Los Angeles. They also show that those two zones are 18 hours apart at that time of the year. task java.time legacy holidays var aet = ZoneId.of(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.fullName == &#39;Australian Eastern Time&#39; &amp;&amp; aet.shortName == &#39;AET&#39;assert aet.offset == ZoneOffset.of(&#39;+11:00&#39;)var melbCupBreakfastInAU = ZonedDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast, aet)var melbCupBreakfast = LocalDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast)assert melbCupBreakfastInAU == melbCupBreakfast &lt;&lt; aetvar pst = ZoneId.of(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.fullName == &#39;Pacific Time&#39; &amp;&amp; pst.shortName == &#39;GMT-08:00&#39;var meanwhileInLA = melbCupBreakfastInAU.withZoneSameInstant(pst)assert halloween22 == meanwhileInLA.toLocalDate()assert aet.offset.hours - pst.offset.hours == 18 var aet = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.displayName == &#39;Australian Eastern Standard Time&#39;assert aet.observesDaylightTime()var melbourneCupBreakfast = new GregorianCalendar(aet).tap { set(year: 2022, month: 10, date: 1, hourOfDay: 7, minute: 30)}var pst = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.displayName == &#39;Pacific Standard Time&#39;var meanwhileInLA = new GregorianCalendar(pst).tap { setTimeInMillis(melbourneCupBreakfast.timeInMillis)}assert meanwhileInLA.time.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;, pst) == halloween22.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;)assert aet.rawOffset / 3600000 - pst.rawOffset / 3600000 == 18 Other useful classes The new date classes offer a few more useful classes. Here are some of the common ones: OffsetDateTime - like ZonedDateTime but with just an offset from UTC rather than a full time-zone Instant - like OffsetDateTime but tied to UTC YearMonth - like a LocalDate but with no day component MonthDay - like a LocalDate but with no year component Period - used to represent periods of time, e.g. Period.ofDays(14), Period.ofYears(2); see also the&nbsp;LocalDate example above. Duration - a time-based amount of time, e.g. Duration.ofSeconds(30), Duration.ofHours(7); see also the&nbsp;LocalTime example above. Conversions It is useful to convert between the new and legacy classes. Some useful conversion methods are shown below with Groovy enhancements shown in blue. From Conversion method/property GregorianCalendar&nbsp; toInstant() toZonedDateTime() from(ZonedDateTime) Calendar toInstant() toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId Date toInstant() from(Instant) toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId ZonedDateTimeOffsetDateTimeLocalDateTimeLocalDateLocalTime toDate() toCalendar() SimpleDateFormat patterns We saw several examples above using the format and parse methods. For the legacy date classes, numerous Groovy enhancements delegate to SimpleDateFormat. This class represents date/time formats using pattern strings. These are special letters to represent some time or date component mixed with escaped literal strings. The special letters are often repeated to represent the minimum size field for number components and whether the full or an abbreviated form is used for other components. As an example, for the U.S. locale and U.S. Pacific Time time zone, the following pattern: yyyy.MM.dd G &#39;at&#39; HH:mm:ss z would apply to the following text: 2001.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT &lt;/p&gt; Letter&nbsp; Description G Era designator AD y Year 1996; 96 Y Week year (similar to year but allotted by weeks; the first/last few days of a year might be allotted to finish/start the last/previous week) M Month in year (context sensitive) July; Jul; 07 L Month in year (standalone form) July; Jul; 07 w Week in year 27 W Week in month 2 D Day in year 189 d Day in month 10 F Day of week in month 2 E Day name in week Tuesday; Tue u Day number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday) a Am/pm marker PM H Hour in day (0-23) 0 k Hour in day (1-24) 24 K Hour in am/pm (0-11) 0 h Hour in am/pm (1-12) 12 m Minute in hour 30 s Second in minute 55 S Millisecond 978 z Time zone Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00 Z Time zone (RFC 822) -0800 X Time zone (ISO 8601) -08; -0800; -08:00 &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; DateTimeFormatter patterns Groovy&#39;s format and parse enhancements for the new date classes delegate to the DateTimeFormatter class. It&#39;s behavior is similar to what we saw for&nbsp;SimpleDateFormat&nbsp;but with slightly different conversion letters: Conversion suffix&nbsp; Description G era AD u year 2004; 04 y year-of-era 2004; 04 D day-of-year 189 M/L month-of-year 7; 07; Jul; July; J d day-of-month 10 Q/q quarter-of-year 3; 03; Q3; 3rd quarter Y week-based-year 1996; 96 w week-of-week-based-year 27 W week-of-month 4 E day-of-week Tue; Tuesday; T e/c localized day-of-week 2; 02; Tue; Tuesday; T F week-of-month 3 a am-pm-of-day PM h clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-12) 12 K hour-of-am-pm (0-11) 0 k clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-24) 0 H hour-of-day (0-23) 0 m minute-of-hour 30 s second-of-minute 55 S fraction-of-second 978 A milli-of-day 1234 n nano-of-second 987654321 N nano-of-day 1234000000 V time-zone ID America/Los_Angeles; Z; -08:30 z time-zone name Pacific Standard Time; PST O localized zone-offset GMT+8; GMT+08:00; UTC-08:00; X zone-offset &#39;Z&#39; for zero Z; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; x zone-offset +0000; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; Z zone-offset +0000; -0800; -08:00; p pad next &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; Localized Patterns JDK19 adds the ofLocalizedPattern(String requestedTemplate) method. The requested template is one or more regular expression pattern symbols ordered from the largest to the smallest unit, and consisting of the following patterns: &quot;G{0,5}&quot; + // Era &quot;y*&quot; + // Year &quot;Q{0,5}&quot; + // Quarter &quot;M{0,5}&quot; + // Month &quot;w*&quot; + // Week of Week Based Year &quot;E{0,5}&quot; + // Day of Week &quot;d{0,2}&quot; + // Day of Month &quot;B{0,5}&quot; + // Period/AmPm of Day &quot;[hHjC]{0,2}&quot; + // Hour of Day/AmPm (refer to LDML for &#39;j&#39; and &#39;C&#39;) &quot;m{0,2}&quot; + // Minute of Hour &quot;s{0,2}&quot; + // Second of Minute &quot;[vz]{0,4}&quot; // Zone The requested template is mapped to the closest of available localized format as defined by the Unicode LDML specification. Here is an example of usage: var now = ZonedDateTime.now()var columns = &#39;%7s | %10s | %10s | %10s | %14s%n&#39;printf columns, &#39;locale&#39;, &#39;GDK&#39;, &#39;custom&#39;, &#39;local&#39;, &#39;both&#39;[locale(&#39;en&#39;, &#39;US&#39;), locale(&#39;ro&#39;, &#39;RO&#39;), locale(&#39;vi&#39;, &#39;VN&#39;)].each { locale -&gt; Locale.default = locale var gdk = now.format(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;) var custom = now.format(ofPattern(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;)) var local = now.format(ofLocalizedDate(SHORT)) var both = now.format(ofLocalizedPattern(&#39;yMM&#39;)) printf columns, locale, gdk, custom, local, both} Which has this output: locale | GDK | custom | local | both en_US | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 12/18/22 | 12/2022 ro_RO | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18.12.2022 | 12.2022 vi_VN | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18/12/2022 | th&aacute;ng 12, 2022 Example credit: this example from Nicolai Parlog. Formatter formats The java.util.Formatter class is a base class in Java for various kinds of formatting. It can be used directly, via String.format, parse, printf, or Groovy&#39;s sprintf. We saw several examples of using printf and parse formatting in the above examples. The Formatter class has methods which take a format string as its first argument and zero or more additional arguments. The format string typically has one or more format specifiers (starting with a percent character) which indicate that a formatted version of one of the additional arguments should be placed into the string at that point. The general form of a format specifier is: %[argument_index$][flag][width][.precision]conversion Most of the parts are optional. The argument_index part is only used when referencing one of the additional arguments more than once (or out of order). The precision part is only used for floating point numbers. The flag part is used to indicate always include sign(+), zero-padding(0), locale-specific comma delimiters(,), and left justification(-). The width indicates the minimum number of characters for the output. The conversion indicates how the argument should be processed, e.g. as a numeric field, a date, a special character, or some other special processing. Upper and lowercase variants exist for most conversions which, for the uppercase variant, will call toUpperCase after the conversion is complete. Conversion&nbsp; Description &#39;b&#39;, &#39;B&#39; Treat as a boolean or false if null &#39;h&#39;, &#39;H&#39; Output the arguments hashcode as a hex string &#39;s&#39;, &#39;S&#39; Treat as a String &#39;c&#39;, &#39;C&#39; Treat as a Unicode character &#39;d&#39; Treat as a decimal integer &#39;o&#39; Treat as an octal integer &#39;x&#39;, &#39;X&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal integer &#39;e&#39;, &#39;E&#39; Treat as a decimal number in scientific notation &#39;f&#39; Treat as a floating point number &#39;g&#39;, &#39;G&#39; Treat as a floating point in either decimal or scientific notation &#39;a&#39;, &#39;A&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal floating-point number &#39;t&#39;, &#39;T&#39; Treat as the prefix for a date/time conversion &#39;%&#39; A literal percent &#39;n&#39; A line separator When the date/time prefix is used, additional suffixes are applicable.

Representing the current date/time The legacy date classes have an abstraction which includes date and time. If you are only interested in one of those two aspects, you simply ignore the other aspect. The new date classes allow you to have date-only, time-only and date-time representations. The examples create instances representing the current date and/or time. Various information is extracted from the instances and they are printed in various ways. Some of the examples use the SV macro which prints the name and string value of one or more variables. task java.time legacy current date and time println LocalDateTime.now() println Instant.now() 2022-10-24T12:40:02.218130200 2022-10-24T02:40:02.223131Z println new Date() println Calendar.instance.time Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 day of current year &amp;day of current month println LocalDateTime.now().dayOfYearprintln LocalDateTime.now().dayOfMonth 297 24 println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_YEAR]println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_MONTH] 297 24 extract today&#39;syear, month &amp; day var now = LocalDate.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.year, now.monthValue, now.dayOfMonth)(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y $M $D&quot; now.year=2022, now.monthValue=10, now.dayOfMonth=24 Today is 2022 10 24 var now = Calendar.instance(_E, Y, M, _WY, _WM, D) = nowprintln &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot;(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot; Today is 2022 10 24 Today is 2022 10 24 alternatives to print today println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 extract parts of current time now = LocalTime.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.hour, now.minute, now.second)(H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE_OF_HOUR, SECOND_OF_MINUTE]printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n&#39;, H, M, S now.hour=12, now.minute=40, now.second=2 The time is 12:40:02 (H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE, SECOND] println SV(H, M, S) printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d%n&#39;, H, M, S H=12, M=40, S=2 The time is 12:40:02 alternatives to print time println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 Processing times The new date classes have a LocalTime class specifically for representing time-only quantities. The legacy date classes don&#39;t have such a purpose-built abstraction; you essentially just ignore the day, month, and year parts of a date. The java.sql.Time class could be used as an alterative but rarely is.&nbsp;The Java documentation comparing the new date classes to their legacy equivalents, talks about using GregorianCalendar with the date set to the epoch value of 1970-01-01 as an approximation of the LocalTime class. We&#39;ll follow that approach here to provide a comparison but we strongly recommend upgrading to the new classes if you need to represent time-only values or use the Joda-Time library on JDK versions prior to 8. &lt;/p&gt; The examples look at representing a minute before and after midnight, and some times at which you might eat your meals. For the meals, as well as printing various values, we might be interested in calculating new times in terms of existing times, e.g. lunch and dinner are 7 hours apart. task java.time legacy one min after midnight LocalTime.of(0, 1).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(MINUTE, 1) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am one min before midnight LocalTime.of(23, 59).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(hourOfDay: 23, minute: 59) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm meal times var breakfast = LocalTime.of(7, 30)var lunch = LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30&#39;)assert lunch == LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30.00 pm&#39;, &#39;hh:mm.ss a&#39;)lunch.with { assert hour == 12 &amp;&amp; minute == 30 }var dinner = lunch.plusHours(7)assert dinner == lunch.plus(7, ChronoUnit.HOURS)assert Duration.between(lunch, dinner).toHours() == 7assert breakfast.isBefore(lunch) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthandassert lunch in breakfast..dinnerassert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.format(FormatStyle.MEDIUM) == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert dinner.timeString == &#39;19:30:00&#39; var breakfast = Date.parse(&#39;hh:mm&#39;, &#39;07:30&#39;)var lunch = Calendar.instance.tap { clear() set(hourOfDay: 12, minute: 30)}assert lunch[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE] == [12, 30]var dinner = lunch.clone().tap { it[HOUR_OF_DAY] += 7 }assert dinner == lunch.copyWith(hourOfDay: 19)assert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.time.timeString == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert breakfast.before(lunch.time) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthand Processing dates To represent date-only information with the legacy date classes, you set the time aspects to zero, or simply ignore them. Alternatively, you could consider the less commonly used&nbsp;java.sql.Date&nbsp;class. The new date classes have the special LocalDate class for this purpose which we highly recommend. The examples create dates for Halloween and Melbourne Cup day (a public holiday in the Australia state of Victoria). We look at various properties of those two dates. task java.time legacy holidays var halloween22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 10, 31)var halloween23 = LocalDate.parse(&#39;2023-Oct-31&#39;, &#39;yyyy-LLL-dd&#39;)assert halloween22 == halloween23 - 365assert halloween23 == halloween22.plusYears(1)var melbourneCup22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 11, 1)assert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert Period.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22).days == 1assert ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22) == 1Lvar days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) {days &lt;&lt; &quot;$it.dayOfWeek&quot; }assert days == [&#39;MONDAY&#39;, &#39;TUESDAY&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 var halloween21 = Date.parse(&#39;dd/MM/yyyy&#39;, &#39;31/10/2021&#39;)var halloween22 = Date.parse(&#39;yyyy-MMM-dd&#39;, &#39;2022-Oct-31&#39;)assert halloween21 + 365 == halloween22var melbourneCup22 = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1).timeassert melbourneCup22.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // AU Localeassert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert melbourneCup22 == halloween22.copyWith(month: 10, date: 1)var days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) { days &lt;&lt; it.format(&#39;EEEEE&#39;) }assert days == [&#39;Monday&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 Processing date and time combinations The new date classes use LocalDateTime to represent a quantity with both date and time aspects. Many of the methods seen earlier will also be applicable here. The examples show creating and printing a representation of lunch on Melbourne Cup day. task java.time legacy holidays var melbourneCupLunch = LocalDateTime.of(2022, 11, 1, 12, 30)assert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;2022-11-01&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;2022-11-01T12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalDate() == melbourneCup22assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalTime() == lunchassert melbourneCupLunch == melbourneCup22 &lt;&lt; lunch var melbourneCupLunch = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1, 12, 30).timeassert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;1/11/22, 12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.clearTime() == melbourneCup22 Processing zoned date and times The legacy date classes have the concept of a TimeZone, predominantly used by the Calendar class. The new date classes has a similar concept but uses the ZoneId, ZoneOffset, and ZonedDateTime classes (among others). The examples show various properties of zones and show that during the Melbourne cup breakfast, it would still be the night before (Halloween) in Los Angeles. They also show that those two zones are 18 hours apart at that time of the year. task java.time legacy holidays var aet = ZoneId.of(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.fullName == &#39;Australian Eastern Time&#39; &amp;&amp; aet.shortName == &#39;AET&#39;assert aet.offset == ZoneOffset.of(&#39;+11:00&#39;)var melbCupBreakfastInAU = ZonedDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast, aet)var melbCupBreakfast = LocalDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast)assert melbCupBreakfastInAU == melbCupBreakfast &lt;&lt; aetvar pst = ZoneId.of(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.fullName == &#39;Pacific Time&#39; &amp;&amp; pst.shortName == &#39;GMT-08:00&#39;var meanwhileInLA = melbCupBreakfastInAU.withZoneSameInstant(pst)assert halloween22 == meanwhileInLA.toLocalDate()assert aet.offset.hours - pst.offset.hours == 18 var aet = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.displayName == &#39;Australian Eastern Standard Time&#39;assert aet.observesDaylightTime()var melbourneCupBreakfast = new GregorianCalendar(aet).tap { set(year: 2022, month: 10, date: 1, hourOfDay: 7, minute: 30)}var pst = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.displayName == &#39;Pacific Standard Time&#39;var meanwhileInLA = new GregorianCalendar(pst).tap { setTimeInMillis(melbourneCupBreakfast.timeInMillis)}assert meanwhileInLA.time.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;, pst) == halloween22.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;)assert aet.rawOffset / 3600000 - pst.rawOffset / 3600000 == 18 Other useful classes The new date classes offer a few more useful classes. Here are some of the common ones: OffsetDateTime - like ZonedDateTime but with just an offset from UTC rather than a full time-zone Instant - like OffsetDateTime but tied to UTC YearMonth - like a LocalDate but with no day component MonthDay - like a LocalDate but with no year component Period - used to represent periods of time, e.g. Period.ofDays(14), Period.ofYears(2); see also the&nbsp;LocalDate example above. Duration - a time-based amount of time, e.g. Duration.ofSeconds(30), Duration.ofHours(7); see also the&nbsp;LocalTime example above. Conversions It is useful to convert between the new and legacy classes. Some useful conversion methods are shown below with Groovy enhancements shown in blue. From Conversion method/property GregorianCalendar&nbsp; toInstant() toZonedDateTime() from(ZonedDateTime) Calendar toInstant() toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId Date toInstant() from(Instant) toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId ZonedDateTimeOffsetDateTimeLocalDateTimeLocalDateLocalTime toDate() toCalendar() SimpleDateFormat patterns We saw several examples above using the format and parse methods. For the legacy date classes, numerous Groovy enhancements delegate to SimpleDateFormat. This class represents date/time formats using pattern strings. These are special letters to represent some time or date component mixed with escaped literal strings. The special letters are often repeated to represent the minimum size field for number components and whether the full or an abbreviated form is used for other components. As an example, for the U.S. locale and U.S. Pacific Time time zone, the following pattern: yyyy.MM.dd G &#39;at&#39; HH:mm:ss z would apply to the following text: 2001.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT &lt;/p&gt; Letter&nbsp; Description G Era designator AD y Year 1996; 96 Y Week year (similar to year but allotted by weeks; the first/last few days of a year might be allotted to finish/start the last/previous week) M Month in year (context sensitive) July; Jul; 07 L Month in year (standalone form) July; Jul; 07 w Week in year 27 W Week in month 2 D Day in year 189 d Day in month 10 F Day of week in month 2 E Day name in week Tuesday; Tue u Day number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday) a Am/pm marker PM H Hour in day (0-23) 0 k Hour in day (1-24) 24 K Hour in am/pm (0-11) 0 h Hour in am/pm (1-12) 12 m Minute in hour 30 s Second in minute 55 S Millisecond 978 z Time zone Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00 Z Time zone (RFC 822) -0800 X Time zone (ISO 8601) -08; -0800; -08:00 &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; DateTimeFormatter patterns Groovy&#39;s format and parse enhancements for the new date classes delegate to the DateTimeFormatter class. It&#39;s behavior is similar to what we saw for&nbsp;SimpleDateFormat&nbsp;but with slightly different conversion letters: Conversion suffix&nbsp; Description G era AD u year 2004; 04 y year-of-era 2004; 04 D day-of-year 189 M/L month-of-year 7; 07; Jul; July; J d day-of-month 10 Q/q quarter-of-year 3; 03; Q3; 3rd quarter Y week-based-year 1996; 96 w week-of-week-based-year 27 W week-of-month 4 E day-of-week Tue; Tuesday; T e/c localized day-of-week 2; 02; Tue; Tuesday; T F week-of-month 3 a am-pm-of-day PM h clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-12) 12 K hour-of-am-pm (0-11) 0 k clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-24) 0 H hour-of-day (0-23) 0 m minute-of-hour 30 s second-of-minute 55 S fraction-of-second 978 A milli-of-day 1234 n nano-of-second 987654321 N nano-of-day 1234000000 V time-zone ID America/Los_Angeles; Z; -08:30 z time-zone name Pacific Standard Time; PST O localized zone-offset GMT+8; GMT+08:00; UTC-08:00; X zone-offset &#39;Z&#39; for zero Z; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; x zone-offset +0000; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; Z zone-offset +0000; -0800; -08:00; p pad next &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; Localized Patterns JDK19 adds the ofLocalizedPattern(String requestedTemplate) method. The requested template is one or more regular expression pattern symbols ordered from the largest to the smallest unit, and consisting of the following patterns: &quot;G{0,5}&quot; + // Era &quot;y*&quot; + // Year &quot;Q{0,5}&quot; + // Quarter &quot;M{0,5}&quot; + // Month &quot;w*&quot; + // Week of Week Based Year &quot;E{0,5}&quot; + // Day of Week &quot;d{0,2}&quot; + // Day of Month &quot;B{0,5}&quot; + // Period/AmPm of Day &quot;[hHjC]{0,2}&quot; + // Hour of Day/AmPm (refer to LDML for &#39;j&#39; and &#39;C&#39;) &quot;m{0,2}&quot; + // Minute of Hour &quot;s{0,2}&quot; + // Second of Minute &quot;[vz]{0,4}&quot; // Zone The requested template is mapped to the closest of available localized format as defined by the Unicode LDML specification. Here is an example of usage: var now = ZonedDateTime.now()var columns = &#39;%7s | %10s | %10s | %10s | %14s%n&#39;printf columns, &#39;locale&#39;, &#39;GDK&#39;, &#39;custom&#39;, &#39;local&#39;, &#39;both&#39;[locale(&#39;en&#39;, &#39;US&#39;), locale(&#39;ro&#39;, &#39;RO&#39;), locale(&#39;vi&#39;, &#39;VN&#39;)].each { locale -&gt; Locale.default = locale var gdk = now.format(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;) var custom = now.format(ofPattern(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;)) var local = now.format(ofLocalizedDate(SHORT)) var both = now.format(ofLocalizedPattern(&#39;yMM&#39;)) printf columns, locale, gdk, custom, local, both} Which has this output: locale | GDK | custom | local | both en_US | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 12/18/22 | 12/2022 ro_RO | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18.12.2022 | 12.2022 vi_VN | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18/12/2022 | th&aacute;ng 12, 2022 Example credit: this example from Nicolai Parlog. Formatter formats The java.util.Formatter class is a base class in Java for various kinds of formatting. It can be used directly, via String.format, parse, printf, or Groovy&#39;s sprintf. We saw several examples of using printf and parse formatting in the above examples. The Formatter class has methods which take a format string as its first argument and zero or more additional arguments. The format string typically has one or more format specifiers (starting with a percent character) which indicate that a formatted version of one of the additional arguments should be placed into the string at that point. The general form of a format specifier is: %[argument_index$][flag][width][.precision]conversion Most of the parts are optional. The argument_index part is only used when referencing one of the additional arguments more than once (or out of order). The precision part is only used for floating point numbers. The flag part is used to indicate always include sign(+), zero-padding(0), locale-specific comma delimiters(,), and left justification(-). The width indicates the minimum number of characters for the output. The conversion indicates how the argument should be processed, e.g. as a numeric field, a date, a special character, or some other special processing. Upper and lowercase variants exist for most conversions which, for the uppercase variant, will call toUpperCase after the conversion is complete. Conversion&nbsp; Description &#39;b&#39;, &#39;B&#39; Treat as a boolean or false if null &#39;h&#39;, &#39;H&#39; Output the arguments hashcode as a hex string &#39;s&#39;, &#39;S&#39; Treat as a String &#39;c&#39;, &#39;C&#39; Treat as a Unicode character &#39;d&#39; Treat as a decimal integer &#39;o&#39; Treat as an octal integer &#39;x&#39;, &#39;X&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal integer &#39;e&#39;, &#39;E&#39; Treat as a decimal number in scientific notation &#39;f&#39; Treat as a floating point number &#39;g&#39;, &#39;G&#39; Treat as a floating point in either decimal or scientific notation &#39;a&#39;, &#39;A&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal floating-point number &#39;t&#39;, &#39;T&#39; Treat as the prefix for a date/time conversion &#39;%&#39; A literal percent &#39;n&#39; A line separator When the date/time prefix is used, additional suffixes are applicable.

Throughout this blog post we refer to those classes as the legacy date classes. Groovy enhances the experience of using the legacy date classes with simpler mechanisms for formatting, parsing and extracting fields from the related classes. Since Java 8, the JDK has included the JSR-310 Date Time API. We refer to these classes as the new date classes. The new date classes remove many limitations of the legacy date classes and bring some greatly appreciated additional consistency. Groovy provides similar enhancements for the new date classes too. Groovy&#39;s enhancements for the legacy date classes are in the groovy-dateutil module (prior to Groovy 2.5, this functionality was built in to the core module). The groovy-datetime module has the enhancements for the new date classes. You can include a dependency to this module in your build file or reference the groovy-all pom dependency. Both modules are part of a standard Groovy install. The next few sections illustrate common date and time tasks and the code to perform them using the new and legacy classes with Groovy enhancements in numerous places. Please note: that some of the formatting commands are Locale dependent and the output may vary slightly if you run these examples yourself. Representing the current date/time The legacy date classes have an abstraction which includes date and time. If you are only interested in one of those two aspects, you simply ignore the other aspect. The new date classes allow you to have date-only, time-only and date-time representations. The examples create instances representing the current date and/or time. Various information is extracted from the instances and they are printed in various ways. Some of the examples use the SV macro which prints the name and string value of one or more variables. task java.time legacy current date and time println LocalDateTime.now() println Instant.now() 2022-10-24T12:40:02.218130200 2022-10-24T02:40:02.223131Z println new Date() println Calendar.instance.time Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 Mon Oct 24 12:40:02 AEST 2022 day of current year &amp;day of current month println LocalDateTime.now().dayOfYearprintln LocalDateTime.now().dayOfMonth 297 24 println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_YEAR]println Calendar.instance[DAY_OF_MONTH] 297 24 extract today&#39;syear, month &amp; day var now = LocalDate.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.year, now.monthValue, now.dayOfMonth)(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y $M $D&quot; now.year=2022, now.monthValue=10, now.dayOfMonth=24 Today is 2022 10 24 var now = Calendar.instance(_E, Y, M, _WY, _WM, D) = nowprintln &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot;(Y, M, D) = now[YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH]println &quot;Today is $Y ${M+1} $D&quot; Today is 2022 10 24 Today is 2022 10 24 alternatives to print today println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 println now.format(&quot;&#39;Today is &#39;YYYY-MM-dd&quot;)printf &#39;Today is %1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te%n&#39;, now Today is 2022-10-24 Today is 2022-10-24 extract parts of current time now = LocalTime.now() // or LocalDateTimeprintln SV(now.hour, now.minute, now.second)(H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE_OF_HOUR, SECOND_OF_MINUTE]printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\\n&#39;, H, M, S now.hour=12, now.minute=40, now.second=2 The time is 12:40:02 (H, M, S) = now[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE, SECOND] println SV(H, M, S) printf &#39;The time is %02d:%02d:%02d%n&#39;, H, M, S H=12, M=40, S=2 The time is 12:40:02 alternatives to print time println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 println now.format(&quot;&#39;The time is &#39;HH:mm:ss&quot;)printf &#39;The time is %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS%n&#39;, now The time is 12:40:02 The time is 12:40:02 Processing times The new date classes have a LocalTime class specifically for representing time-only quantities. The legacy date classes don&#39;t have such a purpose-built abstraction; you essentially just ignore the day, month, and year parts of a date. The java.sql.Time class could be used as an alterative but rarely is.&nbsp;The Java documentation comparing the new date classes to their legacy equivalents, talks about using GregorianCalendar with the date set to the epoch value of 1970-01-01 as an approximation of the LocalTime class. We&#39;ll follow that approach here to provide a comparison but we strongly recommend upgrading to the new classes if you need to represent time-only values or use the Joda-Time library on JDK versions prior to 8. &lt;/p&gt; The examples look at representing a minute before and after midnight, and some times at which you might eat your meals. For the meals, as well as printing various values, we might be interested in calculating new times in terms of existing times, e.g. lunch and dinner are 7 hours apart. task java.time legacy one min after midnight LocalTime.of(0, 1).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(MINUTE, 1) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 00:01 12:01 am 0:01 am one min before midnight LocalTime.of(23, 59).with { println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm Calendar.instance.with { clear() set(hourOfDay: 23, minute: 59) println format(&#39;HH:mm&#39;) println format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) println format(&#39;K:mm a&#39;)} 23:59 11:59 pm 11:59 pm meal times var breakfast = LocalTime.of(7, 30)var lunch = LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30&#39;)assert lunch == LocalTime.parse(&#39;12:30.00 pm&#39;, &#39;hh:mm.ss a&#39;)lunch.with { assert hour == 12 &amp;&amp; minute == 30 }var dinner = lunch.plusHours(7)assert dinner == lunch.plus(7, ChronoUnit.HOURS)assert Duration.between(lunch, dinner).toHours() == 7assert breakfast.isBefore(lunch) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthandassert lunch in breakfast..dinnerassert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.format(FormatStyle.MEDIUM) == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert dinner.timeString == &#39;19:30:00&#39; var breakfast = Date.parse(&#39;hh:mm&#39;, &#39;07:30&#39;)var lunch = Calendar.instance.tap { clear() set(hourOfDay: 12, minute: 30)}assert lunch[HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE] == [12, 30]var dinner = lunch.clone().tap { it[HOUR_OF_DAY] += 7 }assert dinner == lunch.copyWith(hourOfDay: 19)assert dinner.format(&#39;hh:mm a&#39;) == &#39;07:30 pm&#39;assert dinner.format(&#39;k:mm&#39;) == &#39;19:30&#39;assert dinner.time.timeString == &#39;7:30:00 pm&#39;assert breakfast.before(lunch.time) // Java APIassert lunch &lt; dinner // Groovy shorthand Processing dates To represent date-only information with the legacy date classes, you set the time aspects to zero, or simply ignore them. Alternatively, you could consider the less commonly used&nbsp;java.sql.Date&nbsp;class. The new date classes have the special LocalDate class for this purpose which we highly recommend. The examples create dates for Halloween and Melbourne Cup day (a public holiday in the Australia state of Victoria). We look at various properties of those two dates. task java.time legacy holidays var halloween22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 10, 31)var halloween23 = LocalDate.parse(&#39;2023-Oct-31&#39;, &#39;yyyy-LLL-dd&#39;)assert halloween22 == halloween23 - 365assert halloween23 == halloween22.plusYears(1)var melbourneCup22 = LocalDate.of(2022, 11, 1)assert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert Period.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22).days == 1assert ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(halloween22, melbourneCup22) == 1Lvar days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) {days &lt;&lt; &quot;$it.dayOfWeek&quot; }assert days == [&#39;MONDAY&#39;, &#39;TUESDAY&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 var halloween21 = Date.parse(&#39;dd/MM/yyyy&#39;, &#39;31/10/2021&#39;)var halloween22 = Date.parse(&#39;yyyy-MMM-dd&#39;, &#39;2022-Oct-31&#39;)assert halloween21 + 365 == halloween22var melbourneCup22 = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1).timeassert melbourneCup22.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // AU Localeassert halloween22 &lt; melbourneCup22assert melbourneCup22 - halloween22 == 1assert melbourneCup22 == halloween22.copyWith(month: 10, date: 1)var days = []halloween22.upto(melbourneCup22) { days &lt;&lt; it.format(&#39;EEEEE&#39;) }assert days == [&#39;Monday&#39;, &#39;Tuesday&#39;]var hols = halloween22..melbourneCup22assert hols.size() == 2 Processing date and time combinations The new date classes use LocalDateTime to represent a quantity with both date and time aspects. Many of the methods seen earlier will also be applicable here. The examples show creating and printing a representation of lunch on Melbourne Cup day. task java.time legacy holidays var melbourneCupLunch = LocalDateTime.of(2022, 11, 1, 12, 30)assert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;2022-11-01&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;2022-11-01T12:30:00&#39;assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalDate() == melbourneCup22assert melbourneCupLunch.toLocalTime() == lunchassert melbourneCupLunch == melbourneCup22 &lt;&lt; lunch var melbourneCupLunch = new GregorianCalendar(2022, 10, 1, 12, 30).timeassert melbourneCupLunch.timeString == &#39;12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateString == &#39;1/11/22&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.dateTimeString == &#39;1/11/22, 12:30:00 pm&#39; // Locale specificassert melbourneCupLunch.clearTime() == melbourneCup22 Processing zoned date and times The legacy date classes have the concept of a TimeZone, predominantly used by the Calendar class. The new date classes has a similar concept but uses the ZoneId, ZoneOffset, and ZonedDateTime classes (among others). The examples show various properties of zones and show that during the Melbourne cup breakfast, it would still be the night before (Halloween) in Los Angeles. They also show that those two zones are 18 hours apart at that time of the year. task java.time legacy holidays var aet = ZoneId.of(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.fullName == &#39;Australian Eastern Time&#39; &amp;&amp; aet.shortName == &#39;AET&#39;assert aet.offset == ZoneOffset.of(&#39;+11:00&#39;)var melbCupBreakfastInAU = ZonedDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast, aet)var melbCupBreakfast = LocalDateTime.of(melbourneCup22, breakfast)assert melbCupBreakfastInAU == melbCupBreakfast &lt;&lt; aetvar pst = ZoneId.of(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.fullName == &#39;Pacific Time&#39; &amp;&amp; pst.shortName == &#39;GMT-08:00&#39;var meanwhileInLA = melbCupBreakfastInAU.withZoneSameInstant(pst)assert halloween22 == meanwhileInLA.toLocalDate()assert aet.offset.hours - pst.offset.hours == 18 var aet = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;Australia/Sydney&#39;)assert aet.displayName == &#39;Australian Eastern Standard Time&#39;assert aet.observesDaylightTime()var melbourneCupBreakfast = new GregorianCalendar(aet).tap { set(year: 2022, month: 10, date: 1, hourOfDay: 7, minute: 30)}var pst = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;)assert pst.displayName == &#39;Pacific Standard Time&#39;var meanwhileInLA = new GregorianCalendar(pst).tap { setTimeInMillis(melbourneCupBreakfast.timeInMillis)}assert meanwhileInLA.time.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;, pst) == halloween22.format(&#39;MMM dd&#39;)assert aet.rawOffset / 3600000 - pst.rawOffset / 3600000 == 18 Other useful classes The new date classes offer a few more useful classes. Here are some of the common ones: OffsetDateTime - like ZonedDateTime but with just an offset from UTC rather than a full time-zone Instant - like OffsetDateTime but tied to UTC YearMonth - like a LocalDate but with no day component MonthDay - like a LocalDate but with no year component Period - used to represent periods of time, e.g. Period.ofDays(14), Period.ofYears(2); see also the&nbsp;LocalDate example above. Duration - a time-based amount of time, e.g. Duration.ofSeconds(30), Duration.ofHours(7); see also the&nbsp;LocalTime example above. Conversions It is useful to convert between the new and legacy classes. Some useful conversion methods are shown below with Groovy enhancements shown in blue. From Conversion method/property GregorianCalendar&nbsp; toInstant() toZonedDateTime() from(ZonedDateTime) Calendar toInstant() toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId Date toInstant() from(Instant) toZonedDateTime() toOffsetDateTime() toLocalDateTime() toLocalDate() toLocalTime() toOffsetTime() toDayOfWeek() toYear() toYearMonth() toMonth() toMonthDay() zoneOffset zoneId ZonedDateTimeOffsetDateTimeLocalDateTimeLocalDateLocalTime toDate() toCalendar() SimpleDateFormat patterns We saw several examples above using the format and parse methods. For the legacy date classes, numerous Groovy enhancements delegate to SimpleDateFormat. This class represents date/time formats using pattern strings. These are special letters to represent some time or date component mixed with escaped literal strings. The special letters are often repeated to represent the minimum size field for number components and whether the full or an abbreviated form is used for other components. As an example, for the U.S. locale and U.S. Pacific Time time zone, the following pattern: yyyy.MM.dd G &#39;at&#39; HH:mm:ss z would apply to the following text: 2001.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT &lt;/p&gt; Letter&nbsp; Description G Era designator AD y Year 1996; 96 Y Week year (similar to year but allotted by weeks; the first/last few days of a year might be allotted to finish/start the last/previous week) M Month in year (context sensitive) July; Jul; 07 L Month in year (standalone form) July; Jul; 07 w Week in year 27 W Week in month 2 D Day in year 189 d Day in month 10 F Day of week in month 2 E Day name in week Tuesday; Tue u Day number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday) a Am/pm marker PM H Hour in day (0-23) 0 k Hour in day (1-24) 24 K Hour in am/pm (0-11) 0 h Hour in am/pm (1-12) 12 m Minute in hour 30 s Second in minute 55 S Millisecond 978 z Time zone Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00 Z Time zone (RFC 822) -0800 X Time zone (ISO 8601) -08; -0800; -08:00 &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; DateTimeFormatter patterns Groovy&#39;s format and parse enhancements for the new date classes delegate to the DateTimeFormatter class. It&#39;s behavior is similar to what we saw for&nbsp;SimpleDateFormat&nbsp;but with slightly different conversion letters: Conversion suffix&nbsp; Description G era AD u year 2004; 04 y year-of-era 2004; 04 D day-of-year 189 M/L month-of-year 7; 07; Jul; July; J d day-of-month 10 Q/q quarter-of-year 3; 03; Q3; 3rd quarter Y week-based-year 1996; 96 w week-of-week-based-year 27 W week-of-month 4 E day-of-week Tue; Tuesday; T e/c localized day-of-week 2; 02; Tue; Tuesday; T F week-of-month 3 a am-pm-of-day PM h clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-12) 12 K hour-of-am-pm (0-11) 0 k clock-hour-of-am-pm (1-24) 0 H hour-of-day (0-23) 0 m minute-of-hour 30 s second-of-minute 55 S fraction-of-second 978 A milli-of-day 1234 n nano-of-second 987654321 N nano-of-day 1234000000 V time-zone ID America/Los_Angeles; Z; -08:30 z time-zone name Pacific Standard Time; PST O localized zone-offset GMT+8; GMT+08:00; UTC-08:00; X zone-offset &#39;Z&#39; for zero Z; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; x zone-offset +0000; -08; -0830; -08:30; -083015; -08:30:15; Z zone-offset +0000; -0800; -08:00; p pad next &#39; to escape text put a single quote on either side &#39;&#39; two single quotes for a literal single quote &#39; Localized Patterns JDK19 adds the ofLocalizedPattern(String requestedTemplate) method. The requested template is one or more regular expression pattern symbols ordered from the largest to the smallest unit, and consisting of the following patterns: &quot;G{0,5}&quot; + // Era &quot;y*&quot; + // Year &quot;Q{0,5}&quot; + // Quarter &quot;M{0,5}&quot; + // Month &quot;w*&quot; + // Week of Week Based Year &quot;E{0,5}&quot; + // Day of Week &quot;d{0,2}&quot; + // Day of Month &quot;B{0,5}&quot; + // Period/AmPm of Day &quot;[hHjC]{0,2}&quot; + // Hour of Day/AmPm (refer to LDML for &#39;j&#39; and &#39;C&#39;) &quot;m{0,2}&quot; + // Minute of Hour &quot;s{0,2}&quot; + // Second of Minute &quot;[vz]{0,4}&quot; // Zone The requested template is mapped to the closest of available localized format as defined by the Unicode LDML specification. Here is an example of usage: var now = ZonedDateTime.now()var columns = &#39;%7s | %10s | %10s | %10s | %14s%n&#39;printf columns, &#39;locale&#39;, &#39;GDK&#39;, &#39;custom&#39;, &#39;local&#39;, &#39;both&#39;[locale(&#39;en&#39;, &#39;US&#39;), locale(&#39;ro&#39;, &#39;RO&#39;), locale(&#39;vi&#39;, &#39;VN&#39;)].each { locale -&gt; Locale.default = locale var gdk = now.format(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;) var custom = now.format(ofPattern(&#39;y-MM-dd&#39;)) var local = now.format(ofLocalizedDate(SHORT)) var both = now.format(ofLocalizedPattern(&#39;yMM&#39;)) printf columns, locale, gdk, custom, local, both} Which has this output: locale | GDK | custom | local | both en_US | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 12/18/22 | 12/2022 ro_RO | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18.12.2022 | 12.2022 vi_VN | 2022-12-18 | 2022-12-18 | 18/12/2022 | th&aacute;ng 12, 2022 Example credit: this example from Nicolai Parlog. Formatter formats The java.util.Formatter class is a base class in Java for various kinds of formatting. It can be used directly, via String.format, parse, printf, or Groovy&#39;s sprintf. We saw several examples of using printf and parse formatting in the above examples. The Formatter class has methods which take a format string as its first argument and zero or more additional arguments. The format string typically has one or more format specifiers (starting with a percent character) which indicate that a formatted version of one of the additional arguments should be placed into the string at that point. The general form of a format specifier is: %[argument_index$][flag][width][.precision]conversion Most of the parts are optional. The argument_index part is only used when referencing one of the additional arguments more than once (or out of order). The precision part is only used for floating point numbers. The flag part is used to indicate always include sign(+), zero-padding(0), locale-specific comma delimiters(,), and left justification(-). The width indicates the minimum number of characters for the output. The conversion indicates how the argument should be processed, e.g. as a numeric field, a date, a special character, or some other special processing. Upper and lowercase variants exist for most conversions which, for the uppercase variant, will call toUpperCase after the conversion is complete. Conversion&nbsp; Description &#39;b&#39;, &#39;B&#39; Treat as a boolean or false if null &#39;h&#39;, &#39;H&#39; Output the arguments hashcode as a hex string &#39;s&#39;, &#39;S&#39; Treat as a String &#39;c&#39;, &#39;C&#39; Treat as a Unicode character &#39;d&#39; Treat as a decimal integer &#39;o&#39; Treat as an octal integer &#39;x&#39;, &#39;X&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal integer &#39;e&#39;, &#39;E&#39; Treat as a decimal number in scientific notation &#39;f&#39; Treat as a floating point number &#39;g&#39;, &#39;G&#39; Treat as a floating point in either decimal or scientific notation &#39;a&#39;, &#39;A&#39; Treat as a hexadecimal floating-point number &#39;t&#39;, &#39;T&#39; Treat as the prefix for a date/time conversion &#39;%&#39; A literal percent &#39;n&#39; A line separator When the date/time prefix is used, additional suffixes are applicable.

    <p>Java has had a <code>Date</code> class from the very beginning and Groovy supports using it and several related classes like <code>Calendar</code>. Throughout this blog post we refer to those classes as the <i style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>legacy date classes</b></i>.<br />
Groovy enhances the experience of using the legacy date classes with simpler mechanisms for formatting, parsing and extracting fields from the related classes.</p>
<p>Since Java 8, the JDK has included the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" target="_blank">JSR-310</a> Date Time API. We refer to these classes as the <i style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>new date classes</b></i>. The new date classes remove many limitations of the legacy date classes and bring some greatly appreciated additional consistency. Groovy provides similar enhancements for the new date classes too.</p>
<p>Groovy's enhancements for the legacy date classes are in the <code>groovy-dateutil</code> module (prior to Groovy 2.5, this functionality was built in to the core module). The <code>groovy-datetime</code> module has the enhancements for the new date classes. You can include a dependency to this module in your build file or reference the <code>groovy-all</code> pom dependency. Both modules are part of a standard Groovy install.</p>
<p>The next few sections illustrate common date and time tasks and the code to perform them using the new and legacy classes with Groovy enhancements in numerous places.</p>
<p><b>Please note</b>: that some of the formatting commands are <i>Locale dependent</i> and the output <i>may vary</i> slightly if you run these examples yourself.<br></p>
<h2>Representing the current date/time</h2>
<p>The legacy date classes have an abstraction which includes date and time. If you are only interested in one of those two aspects, you simply ignore the other aspect. The new date classes allow you to have date-only, time-only and date-time representations.</p>
<table cellspacing="5px">
<tbody>
<tr></tr>

</table>
<p>The examples create instances representing the current date and/or time. Various information is extracted from the instances and they are printed in various ways. Some of the examples use the <code>SV</code> macro which prints the name and string value of one or more variables.</p>

<h2>Processing times</h2>
<p>The new date classes have a <code>LocalTime</code> class specifically for representing time-only quantities. The legacy date classes don't have such a purpose-built abstraction; you essentially just ignore the day, month, and year parts of a date. The <code>java.sql.Time</code> class could be used as an alterative but rarely is.&nbsp;The Java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/legacy.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">documentation comparing the new date classes to their legacy equivalents</a>, talks about<br />
using <code>GregorianCalendar</code> with the date set to the epoch value of <code>1970-01-01</code><br />
as an approximation of the <code>LocalTime</code> class. We'll follow that approach here to provide a comparison but we <i>strongly recommend</i> upgrading to the<br />
new classes if you need to represent time-only values or use the <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Joda-Time</a> library on JDK versions prior to 8.</p></p>
<p>The examples look at representing a minute before and after midnight, and some times at which you might eat your meals. For the meals, as well as printing various values, we might be interested in calculating new times in terms of existing times, e.g. lunch and dinner are 7 hours apart.<br />

<h2>Processing dates</h2>
<p>To represent date-only information with the legacy date classes, you set the time aspects to zero, or simply ignore them. Alternatively, you could consider the less commonly used&nbsp;<code>java.sql.Date</code>&nbsp;class. The new date classes have the special <code>LocalDate</code> class for this purpose which we highly recommend.</p>
<p>The examples create dates for Halloween and Melbourne Cup day (a public holiday in the Australia state of Victoria). We look at various properties of those two dates.</p>

<h2>Processing date and time combinations</h2>

<h2>Processing zoned date and times</h2>
<p>
The legacy date classes have the concept of a <code>TimeZone</code>, predominantly used by the Calendar class. The new date classes has a similar concept but uses the <code>ZoneId</code>, <code>ZoneOffset</code>, and <code>ZonedDateTime</code> classes (among others).</p>
<p>The examples show various properties of zones and show that during the Melbourne cup breakfast, it would still be the night before (Halloween) in Los Angeles. They also show that those two zones are 18 hours apart at that time of the year.</p>

<h2>Other useful classes</h2>
<p>The new date classes offer a few more useful classes. Here are some of the common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OffsetDateTime</code> - like <code>ZonedDateTime</code> but with just an offset from UTC rather than a full time-zone</li>
<li><code>Instant</code> - like <code>OffsetDateTime</code> but tied to UTC</li>
<li><code>YearMonth</code> - like a <code>LocalDate</code> but with no day component</li>
<li><code>MonthDay</code> - like a <code>LocalDate</code> but with no year component</li>
<li><code>Period</code> - used to represent periods of time, e.g. <code>Period.ofDays(14)</code>, <code>Period.ofYears(2)</code>; see also the&nbsp;<code>LocalDate</code> example above.</li>
<li><code>Duration</code> - a time-based amount of time, e.g. <code>Duration.ofSeconds(30)</code>, <code>Duration.ofHours(7)</code>; see also the&nbsp;<code>LocalTime</code> example above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conversions</h2>
<p>It is useful to convert between the new and legacy classes. Some useful conversion methods are shown below with Groovy enhancements shown in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.</p>
<table style="width:70%;">

<h2>SimpleDateFormat patterns</h2>
<p>
We saw several examples above using the <code>format</code> and <code>parse</code> methods. For the legacy date classes, numerous Groovy enhancements delegate to <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" target="_blank">SimpleDateFormat</a></code>.<br />
This class represents date/time formats using pattern strings. These are special letters to represent some time or date component mixed with escaped literal strings. The special letters are often repeated to represent the minimum size field for number components and whether the full or an abbreviated form is used for other components.</p>
<p>As an example, for the U.S. locale and U.S. Pacific Time time zone, the following pattern:</p>
<pre>yyyy.MM.dd G 'at' HH:mm:ss z</pre>
<p>would apply to the following text:</p>
<pre>2001.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT</pre></p>

<h2>DateTimeFormatter patterns</h2>
<p>Groovy's <code>format</code> and <code>parse</code> enhancements for the new date classes delegate to the <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html" target="_blank">DateTimeFormatter</a></code> class.

<h3 id="localizedPatterns">Localized Patterns</h3>
<p>JDK19 adds the <code>ofLocalizedPattern(String requestedTemplate)</code> method. The requested template is one or more regular expression pattern symbols ordered from the largest to the smallest unit, and<br />
consisting of the following patterns:</p>
<pre>     "G{0,5}" +        // Era
     "y*" +            // Year
     "Q{0,5}" +        // Quarter
     "M{0,5}" +        // Month
     "w*" +            // Week of Week Based Year
     "E{0,5}" +        // Day of Week
     "d{0,2}" +        // Day of Month
     "B{0,5}" +        // Period/AmPm of Day
     "[hHjC]{0,2}" +   // Hour of Day/AmPm (refer to LDML for 'j' and 'C')
     "m{0,2}" +        // Minute of Hour
     "s{0,2}" +        // Second of Minute
     "[vz]{0,4}"       // Zone
</pre>
<p>The requested template is mapped to the closest of available localized format as defined by the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#availableFormats_appendItems" target="_blank">Unicode LDML specification</a>. Here is an example of usage:<br></p>

<h2>Formatter formats</h2>
<p>The <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Formatter.html" target="_blank">java.util.Formatter</a></code> class is a base class in Java for various kinds of formatting. It can be used directly, via <code>String.format</code>, <code>parse</code>, <code>printf</code>, or Groovy's <code>sprintf</code>.<br />
We saw several examples of using <code>printf</code> and <code>parse</code> formatting in the above examples.</p>
<p>
The <code>Formatter</code> class has methods which take a format string as its first argument and zero or more additional arguments.<br />
The format string typically has one or more format specifiers (starting with a percent character) which<br />
indicate that a formatted version of one of the additional arguments should be placed into the string at that point.<br />
The general form of a format specifier is:</p>
<pre>%[argument_index$][flag][width][.precision]conversion</pre>
<p>
Most of the parts are optional. The <code>argument_index</code> part is only used when referencing<br />
one of the additional arguments more than once (or out of order). The <code>precision</code> part<br />
is only used for floating point numbers. The <code>flag</code> part is used to indicate always include sign(+),<br />
zero-padding(0), locale-specific comma delimiters(,), and left justification(-).<br />
The <code>width</code> indicates the minimum number of characters for the output.<br />
The <code>conversion</code> indicates how the argument should be processed, e.g. as a numeric field, a date,<br />
a special character, or some other special processing. Upper and lowercase variants exist for most conversions<br />
which, for the uppercase variant, will call <code>toUpperCase</code> after the conversion is complete.</p>
