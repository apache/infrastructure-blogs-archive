<meta name="description" content="IBM have announced that they are acquiring Cloudant. Adam Kocoloski is co-founder and CTO of Cloudant as well as serving on CouchDB&#39;s Project Management Committee. And with his permission, I am re-posting an email he sent to the CouchDB developer list a few hours ago. In his words: &quot;Apache CouchDB means a great deal to me, and to Cloudant as a company. Cloudant and CouchDB have grown alongside each other over the past several years in one of the more authentic vendor/community collaborations I can think of in Apache history. Today marks the next step in Cloudant&rsquo;s growth as we enter into a definitive agreement to become part of IBM. &quot;What does this mean for CouchDB? I would not have agreed to this transaction if I had any concerns about Cloudant&rsquo;s ability to continue its contributions and collaboration with Apache CouchDB. IBM has a strong track record in open source software and a productive relationship with Apache; in fact, IBM was instrumental in bringing CouchDB to the ASF many years ago. IBM is fully supportive of our efforts here, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to bringing increased resources to bear in support of the project. &quot;CouchDB has the potential to shape the future of distributed data management and computing. 2013 was a year of tremendous progress, as we doubled our committer base and shipped no fewer than eight releases. Already in 2014 we&rsquo;ve seen amazing progress on long-standing initiatives to enhance the core of the system. The timing is right &mdash; in the market and for the community &mdash; to take the next big step forward. With your help, that is exactly what we will do. &quot;Truly, the future of CouchDB is CouchDB.&quot; Thanks Adam! I&#39;d like to extend my hearty congratulations to everyone at Cloudant.
