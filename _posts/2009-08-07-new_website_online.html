<p>As you may have noticed, we recently spent lots of time for updating the website. A new version of the Log4PHP Site can be found here:<br />
http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/</p>
<p>We included project reports like Code coverage or PHPUnit testing results. Additionally we published all the changes which are currently done in the trunk. Besides that we have updated some documentation.</p>
<p>A "how to contribute" for the guys of you who always wanted to help with Log4PHP can be found here:<br />
http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/volunteering.html<br />
http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/contributingpatches.html</p>
<p>Please feel free to help with the development! Any suggestions, contributions are welcome, be it documentation, users experience, code patches.</p>
