<p>Since<br />
1999, The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has been recognized as a<br />
leading source for Open Source software and tools that meet the<br />
demand for interoperable, adaptable, and sustainable solutions.  </p>
<p>The<br />
all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates dozens of<br />
enterprise-grade Open Source projects that power mission-critical<br />
applications in financial services, aerospace, publishing,<br />
government, healthcare, research, infrastructure, and more. From<br />
Abdera to ZooKeeper, the ASF's reliable, community-driven software<br />
continues to grow dramatically across many categories, including<br />
Cloud, IoT and Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Deep<br />
Learning, Mobile, and Big Data, where the Apache Hadoop ecosystem<br />
dominates the marketplace.</p>
