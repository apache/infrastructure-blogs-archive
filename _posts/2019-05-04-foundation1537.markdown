  <div>When the ASF incorporated in 1999, its core membership comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group grew with Committers —developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership:</div> 
  <div> 
    <p> </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>to &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; (contribute) directly to the code repository;</li> 
      <li>the right to vote on community-related decisions; and</li> 
      <li>the ability propose an active user for Committership.</li> 
    </ul> 
  </div> 
  <p>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation's growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing Members.</p> 
  <div>This election brings the total number of ASF Members to 771 today. Individuals elected as ASF Members legally serve as the &quot;shareholders&quot; of the Foundation <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html">https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html</a></div>
