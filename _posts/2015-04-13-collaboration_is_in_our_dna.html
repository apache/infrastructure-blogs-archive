  content: These are examples.  It is typical in this category that source code is
    not disclosed or is not available under one of the licenses higher in the diagram.  Of
    course, bespoke software can be developed and made available as open source.  I
    have done that, with the client's consent.

    generated in the derivative projects incline too much to \r\ncosmetic changes
    that they are not going to taste to the whole world \r\n(I like the current interface).
    \r\n\r\nSome attempt of adding a project management application in the style of
    Calligra Plan (KPlato)?\r\n\r\nI think that there would be many more interested
    parties if this type of functionality\r\nwas added to the Suite. \r\n"

    guys planning to release a new updated Open Office Version this year?

    inefficiency and turned development into a smooth and open process. Competition
    was opened and the inefficient side lost traction. '

    the kind of applications one can create. Bespoke and Commercial applications can
    also be non-proprietary.

  content: "It's definitely not a win-win situation. For users, permissive licenses
    like Apache are downright harmful. These licenses allow anyone to take the code
    and close it up, meaning additional features added to the core (rendering, format
    support, etc.) wouldn't be available in open-source implementations. If a user
    starts relying on these features, they're effectively tied to a proprietary product.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're serious about collaboration, why not switch to the MPL? That would allow
    you to share code with LibreOffice and the user would be in control of their documents.
    Win-win."

  content: "I must say I cannot imagine joining with LO.\r\nOur company switched to
    LO for faster working on Win8.\r\nAnd the first thing we noticed was that they,
    LO, were changing a lot making Writer less usable (more clicks to do the same
    thing and so on).\r\nAnd above all, they still do not follow \"an average user's
    needs\", but instead, like Microsoft :), they employ their own \"fan devs\" ideas.\r\nJust
    simple examples: non-printing characters are blue now. Anybody who worked hours
    editing texts knows that the colours decrease readability. \r\nNo one-click \"remove
    formatting\" to default. Why? Because some people, when copying text from websites,
    want to save it with active links but remove all other formatting.\r\nIt is clear
    that there is nobody there who control these wet dev fantasies in a direction
    \"it has to work, not to be fun\". So I hardly see that anybody of OO could explain
    to these teenagers, at least mental ones, that an office suite is for work."

    other open source projects should be limited - the world needs a true variety
    and not similar products with different names...\r\nAOO should have a tight collaboration
    with academic institutions around the world.\r\nBugzilla issues can serve as projects
    for computer science students."

  content: "Would it be an idea to merge with LibreOffice and continue with one code
    base under the Open Document Foundation? They use a copyleft license, so there
    is forward compatibility and it means the code and community stays open to prevent
    dead ends. They have a very active community that could sure help with expanding
    the number of developers working on the core code and speed up the release cycle.\r\n\r\nThere
    was an interesting article about the community activity recently: https://lwn.net/Articles/637735/"

<p>Apache OpenOffice is living in interesting times, and this is a good moment to reflect on future scenarios.</p>
<p>The old OpenOffice.org project spawned numerous derivative products and we are proud to see how the OpenOffice ecosystem, taken as a whole, has grown so far.</p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice is distributed under a license (the Apache 2 license) that by design permits anyone to reuse the code and create derivative products almost under any license, ranging from copyleft to proprietary. The Apache Software Foundation has been really successful in creating and nurturing open source communities leveraging code distributed under the Apache License, and we aim to be one of those successes.</p>
<p>When considering collaboration between a project and its derivatives one important aspect is how and if upstream changes are submitted to the original project. Basically, permissive licenses like the Apache License are forward-compatible with nearly any other kind of license, but backward-compatible only with other permissive licenses.</p>

<p>We are really glad to be able to provide other open source projects as well as proprietary products with a rock solid platform to build on top of. Projects like AndrOpen Office, LibreOffice, NeoOffice, Ooo4Kids and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/porting/">others</a> are all benefiting from our work, and we&rsquo;d love to be able to keep releasing new versions at a steady pace and make all of&nbsp; this possible.</p>
<p>We fully understand that some of these projects rely on their customizations as an &ldquo;added value&rdquo;, but it is also true that collaborating with the main OpenOffice project -&nbsp; if the partnership is limited to working on the common functionality - would be a win-win, since needs are basically identical. </p>
<p>Considering that OpenOffice is currently in the need to expand the number of its developers, we believe that seeing our release cycle slow down would damage the whole OpenOffice ecosystem.</p>
<p>We want to continue serving all those different communities, and to do that we need your help. We invite all the most relevant OpenOffice derivative products and their communities or vendors to join us in discussing further ideas for collaboration and improvements. For example, we could organize what would be the first "OpenOffice Ecosystem Meetup", but we are open to explore all options.</p>
