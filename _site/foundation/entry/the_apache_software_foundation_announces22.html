<meta name="description" content="Innovative Open Source interoperability toolkit provides any-platform access and support for all major Cloud service providers Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 15 February 2012 &ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced that Apache Deltacloud has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the Project&rsquo;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&rsquo;s meritocratic process and principles. Apache Deltacloud defines a RESTful Web Service application programming interface (API) for interacting with Cloud service providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the most popular Clouds such as Amazon, Eucalyptus, GoGrid, IBM, Microsoft, OpenStack, Rackspace, and more. In addition to the API server, the project also provides client libraries for a wide variety of languages. &quot;We are thrilled to have the project&#39;s growth and maturity recognized by The Apache Software Foundation,&quot; said David Lutterkort, Chair of the Apache Deltacloud Project Management Committee and Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat., &quot;Deltacloud has shown the value of vendor-neutral cloud management API&#39;s, and we are excited that, as an Apache Top-Level Project, we will continue to provide choice to cloud users; graduation is a great milestone for our community.&quot; &quot;Ubiquity between clouds will be critical in the coming years and Deltacloud enables developers to only have to code towards one API,&quot; said Mark Worsey, CIO and EVP of Technology at GoGrid. &quot;At GoGrid, we feel it is extremely important to continue openness within the cloud community and provide APIs that are accessible, useful and adopted by other 3rd party libraries like Deltacloud.&quot; &quot;Deltacloud is another example of how open source development continues to drive cloud innovation and development,&quot; said Tim Cramer, Vice President of Engineering at Eucalyptus Systems. &quot;Deltacloud delivers an elegant ReST API, focused on exposing the differences between cloud services. jclouds and Deltacloud have a strong history together, starting with collaborating on abstraction design in 2009, spiking with our interface to Deltacloud released last year. I&#39;m excited to see Deltacloud&#39;s graduation, and looking forward to more shared code this year,&quot; said Adrian Cole, founder of jclouds.org and CTO jclouds at CloudSoft. Initially proposed for development within the ASF by Lutterkort in May 2010, Deltacloud was seeded with code developed by Red Hat. Since then, the project has continued to innovate by expanding both its committer base and the diversity of clouds it can manage. Availability and OversightApache Deltacloud software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&rsquo;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Apache Deltacloud source code, documentation, mailing lists, and related resources are available at http://deltacloud.apache.org/. About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world&#39;s most popular Web server software.
