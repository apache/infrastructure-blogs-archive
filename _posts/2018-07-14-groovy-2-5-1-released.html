Dear community,</p>
<p>The Apache Groovy team is pleased to announce version 2.5.1 of Apache Groovy.<br />
Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the JVM.<br />
Further details can be found at the <a href="http://groovy.apache.org/">http://groovy.apache.org</a> website.</p>
<p>For this release we focused on fixing up some of the usability/packaging issues<br />
that the 2.5.0 release introduced as part of supporting Groovy across<br />
JDKs 7 through (soon) 11. Maven/Gradle users not needing JAXB should<br />
now have a much improved experience building with the new version.<br />
(SUREFIRE users should read the release notes about some caveats).<br />
In 2.5.2, we should have additional changes to improve the build<br />
experience even further<br />
for JAXB users and users of the Groovy command-line tools. Please read<br />
the release<br />
notes for further information:<br />

<p>This release is a maintenance release of the GROOVY_2_5_X branch.<br />
It is strongly encouraged that all users using prior<br />
versions on this branch upgrade to this version.</p>
<p>This release includes 44 bug fixes/improvements as outlined in the changelog:<br />
