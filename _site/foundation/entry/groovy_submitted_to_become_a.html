<meta name="description" content="The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has confirmed today that the Groovy dynamic object-oriented programming language has formally submitted itself to the Apache Incubator in order to become part of the Foundation&#39;s efforts. [1] The incubation of Groovy is the first step to becoming an ASF Top-Level Project. The Groovy community will join more than 350 Open Source initiatives overseen by the ASF --including 35 projects in the Apache Incubator-- and will benefit from the Foundation&#39;s widely-emulated community-driven process, stewardship, infrastructure, outreach, and events. &lt;/p&gt; &quot;We are happy to welcome Groovy to the Apache Incubator,&quot; said ASF Vice Chairman Greg Stein. &quot;Groovy has a diverse and active community that will find &#39;The Apache Way&#39; of meritocratic development a perfect complement to their existing recognition of the value and benefits of the Apache License, under which their code is released. The ASF&#39;s proven framework will offer Groovy the organizational, legal, financial, and infrastructure support needed to continue to be available to its established user base and millions of developers worldwide.&quot; The Apache Incubator is the entry path into The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation&#39;s efforts. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join Apache enter through the Incubator. Since its creation in 2002, the Apache Incubator has mentored 220 projects: 148 have graduated as Apache Top-level Projects, 35 are currently under incubation, and 37 were retired. Further information on the Apache Incubator is available at http://incubator.apache.org/. &lt;/p&gt; &quot;After seeing (Apache Member and Groovy creator) James Strachan&#39;s Groovy talk at OSCON in 2004, I find it wonderful serendipity to see it arrive at the Foundation a decade later,&quot; added Stein.
