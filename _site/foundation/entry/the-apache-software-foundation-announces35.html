<meta name="description" content="Augments ASF Platinum Sponsorship with Targeted Sponsorship at the Platinum Level&nbsp; Wakefield, MA &mdash;31 May 2018&mdash; The Apache&reg; Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today expanded support provided by Oath, a long-term ASF Platinum Sponsor. Oath, a subsidiary of Verizon, reaches over one billion people around the world with a house of brands including Yahoo, AOL, HuffPost, TechCrunch, Tumblr, and more. Oath is an active Apache community supporter, and, through its brands, has a long history of technical excellence and leadership in Open Source. In particular, Yahoo engineers have made significant contributions to numerous Apache projects, including Hadoop, Storm, Spark, HBase, Oozie, Hive, Pig, Tez, Zookeeper, Bookkeeper, and Traffic Server. Dozens of Oath employees are recognized Apache Committers, many of whom have been and continue to be elected as ASF Members, serve on Project Management Committees (PMCs), and chair PMCs. The ASF recently announced its new Targeted Sponsors, who provide the Foundation with contributions for specific activities or programs, such as donating cloud services, funding a project hackathon, providing legal services, offering community member benefits, underwriting expenses for ApacheCon, as well as other means of supporting the ASF. In addition to Oath&#39;s Platinum-level sponsorship of the ASF, the company is helping boost the efforts of the ASF&#39;s infrastructure team by donating colocation space, machines, and onsite technical support. &quot;As dedicated ASF participants who have benefitted from and given back to the community, we know how important the Foundation&rsquo;s work is to the advancement of technology for all,&quot; said Mark Holderbaugh, VP of software development at Oath. &quot;Our multipronged support is a declaration of the Foundation&#39;s value and we are very pleased to continue to lend our expertise and resources to further The Apache Way.&quot; &quot;ASF Sponsors such as Oath help us run our day-to-day operations,&quot; said Phil Steitz, ASF Chairman. &quot;Targeted Sponsorships allows us the ability to provide support in additional areas of need. Each day, more than 300 Apache projects and their communities rely on build services that are maintained by the ASF Infrastructure Team. The generosity provided by Oath helps us expand our infrastructure services beyond continuous integration and testing, to enable automated website generation and more. Their efforts, in turn, help our community at-large, and benefit the billions of Apache users around the world.&quot; The ASF Infrastructure Team is distributed across three continents, and keeps the Foundation&#39;s&nbsp; services running 24x7x365 at near 100% uptime at less than US$5,000 per project. As the ASF is a purely virtual organization, it does not have offices or buildings; its only physical existence is the technical infrastructure that enables it to operate.

<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Wakefield, MA &mdash;31 May 2018&mdash;</strong> The Apache<sup>&reg;</sup> Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today expanded support provided by Oath, a long-term ASF Platinum Sponsor.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oath, a subsidiary of Verizon, reaches over one billion people around the world with a house of brands including Yahoo, AOL, HuffPost, TechCrunch, Tumblr, and more. Oath is an active Apache community supporter, and, through its brands, has a long history of technical excellence and leadership in Open Source. In particular, Yahoo engineers have made significant contributions to numerous Apache projects, including Hadoop, Storm, Spark, HBase, Oozie, Hive, Pig, Tez, Zookeeper, Bookkeeper, and Traffic Server. Dozens of Oath employees are recognized Apache Committers, many of whom have been and continue to be elected as ASF Members, serve on Project Management Committees (PMCs), and chair PMCs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ASF recently announced its new Targeted Sponsors, who provide the Foundation with contributions for specific activities or programs, such as donating cloud services, funding a project hackathon, providing legal services, offering community member benefits, underwriting expenses for ApacheCon, as well as other means of supporting the ASF.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to Oath's Platinum-level sponsorship of the ASF, the company is helping boost the efforts of the ASF's infrastructure team by donating colocation space, machines, and onsite technical support.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"As dedicated ASF participants who have benefitted from and given back to the community, we know how important the Foundation&rsquo;s work is to the advancement of technology for all," said Mark Holderbaugh, VP of software development at Oath. "Our multipronged support is a declaration of the Foundation's value and we are very pleased to continue to lend our expertise and resources to further The Apache Way."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"ASF Sponsors such as Oath help us run our day-to-day operations," said Phil Steitz, ASF Chairman. "Targeted Sponsorships allows us the ability to provide support in additional areas of need. Each day, more than 300 Apache projects and their communities rely on build services that are maintained by the ASF Infrastructure Team. The generosity provided by Oath helps us expand our infrastructure services beyond continuous integration and testing, to enable automated website generation and more. Their efforts, in turn, help our community at-large, and benefit the billions of Apache users around the world."</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ASF Infrastructure Team is distributed across three continents, and keeps the Foundation's&nbsp; services running 24x7x365 at near 100% uptime at less than US$5,000 per project. As the ASF is a purely virtual organization, it does not have offices or buildings; its only physical existence is the technical infrastructure that enables it to operate.
