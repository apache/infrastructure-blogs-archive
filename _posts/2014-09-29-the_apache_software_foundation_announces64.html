<div><i><b>Easy-to-integrate distributed Open Source real-time computation framework adds reliable data processing capabilities to Apache Hadoop</b></i></div></p>
<div>
<p><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;29 September 2014&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 200 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&trade; Storm&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div>
<div>"Apache Storm's graduation is not only an indication of its maturity as a technology, but also of the robust, active community that develops and supports it," said P. Taylor Goetz, Vice President of Apache Storm. "Storm&rsquo;s vibrant community ensures that Storm will continue to evolve to meet the demands of real-time stream processing and computation use cases."</div></p>
<div>
<p>Apache Storm is a high-performance, easy-to-implement distributed real-time computation framework for processing fast, large streams of data, adding reliable data processing capabilities to Apache Hadoop. Using Storm, a Hadoop cluster can efficiently process a full range of workloads, from real-time to interactive to batch.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Storm was originally developed at BackType prior to being acquired by Twitter, and entered the Apache Incubator in September 2013. The project currently has code contributions from individual committers representing Hortonworks, Twitter, Verisign, and Yahoo, among others.</p>
<p>"Becoming a top level project is huge for Storm and a testament to how active and diverse our user and developer communities are. Four years ago Storm was nothing more than an idea and it's been incredible to watch its growth from being open-sourced through joining the Apache incubator and now through graduation," said Nathan Marz, original creator of Storm.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div></p>
<div>
<p>"Today's announcement marks a major milestone in the continued evolution of Storm since Yahoo initiated the proposal to move it to Apache in 2012. We are proud of our continued contributions to Storm that have led to the hardening of security, multi-tenancy support, and increased scalability. Today, Apache Storm is widely adopted at Yahoo for real-time data processing needs including content personalization, advertising, and mobile development. It's thrilling to see the Hadoop ecosystem and community expand with the continued adoption of Storm," said Andrew Feng, Distinguished Architect at Yahoo.</p>
</p></div></p>
<div>
<p>"The Storm community has come together, has built some fantastic software and has now graduated to top-level. &nbsp;This process has been a great example of open source community building at its best," said Ted Dunning, Apache Storm Incubator Mentor.</p>
</p></div>
<div>Storm is ideal for real-time data processing workloads, and is used to define information sources and manipulations to allow batch, distributed processing of streaming data. &nbsp;Benchmarked as processing one million 100 byte messages per second per node, Storm is fault-tolerant, scalable across clusters of machines, and easy to operate. Developers can write Storm topologies using any programming language, with production-suitable configurations capable in one day. In addition, Storm easily integrates with database systems, handling parallelization, partitioning, and retrying on failures where necessary.</div></p>
<div>
<p>"Graduation to a top level project gives users the confidence that they can adopt Apache Storm knowing that it's backed by a robust, sustainable developer community and the governance framework and processes of the ASF," added Goetz. "As a Chair of the Project Management Committee for Storm, I focus much of my energy encouraging developers to contribute code and get involved in the Storm community. We encourage this collaboration because it is the lifeblood of rapid, reliable innovation."</p>
</p></div>
<div><b>Availability and Oversight</b></div>
<div>As with all Apache products, Apache Storm software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

<p><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)<br /></b>Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than two hundred leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server --the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 450 individual Members and 4,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including Budget Direct, Citrix, Cloudera, Comcast, Facebook, Google, Hortonworks, HP, Huawei, IBM, InMotion Hosting, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, Pivotal, Produban, WANdisco, and Yahoo.
