As part of our recent new release of Apache JSPWiki 2.10.2, we’re pleased to announce that the JSPWiki project has a brand new blog home—right here on <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki" target="_blank" title="JSPWiki blog homepage">https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki</a>. Over the coming weeks we’ll be sharing news, tips, and feature highlights—so be sure to check back regularly. The RSS feed for your favourite news reader is <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki/feed/entries/atom" title="JSPWiki blog RSS feed" target="_blank">here</a> (and for folks who prefer social networks, we have a revived presence on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheJSPWiki" title="JSPWiki on Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jspwiki" title="JSPWiki on Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).

  <p>For JSPWiki 2.10.2, you can check out the list of terrific new features <a href="https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=NewIn2.10" title="New features in JSPWiki 2.10.2" target="_blank">here</a>. As well as code rewrites for core components, support for running in Docker containers, and fixes for popular supporting application servers, the new <a href="https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Haddock%20Template" title="Link to the Haddock template documentation" target="_blank">Haddock</a> template has been enabled by default. Previously only available as a manually configured option, Haddock has matured sufficiently to serve as our production-ready, next-generation template. There’s a huge number of improvements in Haddock compared with JSPWiki’s legacy templates, and we’ll be covering some highlights in future blog posts. If your site is running an older JSPWiki version, consider giving it a substantial visual and feature boost by updating to 2.10.2.
