  content: 'where the hell is your feedback link? your stupid program doesn''t work
    right. whenever i try to insert pictures into a document, it works for a minute,
    then it totally rearranges the pictures i tried to add to the page by copy/pasting
    the previous pic inserted. your dumb office product should allow us to copy/ paste
    pics so we can make a full sheet of whatever images we want. instead it never
    works it just rearranges them  . The pics do not stick on the page where we put
    them. There is more to designing a page than mere "insert image". we also have
    to rearrange them accurately and they have to stick where we move them to.  this
    is entirely frustrating and totally insane. how dare you do this to people. it''s
    outrageous. jerks. '

  content: "Hi everybody!\r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks for the great work on AOO - but...:\r\nWhy
    is it such a problem to install a \"microupdate\" upon an existing AOO installation?
    This was/is the case unde Windows as well as under Linux and for 4.1.0 as well
    as for 4.1.1? (During the installation of 4.1.1 under Windows 7 32bit the installation
    routine tells me to close 4.1.1 and the 4.1.1 quickstarter which i am just about
    to install...). I guess that I can fix this by uninstalling the existing 4.1.0
    and than install the 4.1.1.\r\nCan't you see that you are ruining your good work
    with this update policy? A lot of people will not accept this inconvenient mode
    of updating their existing AOO-Installation...\r\n\r\n"
