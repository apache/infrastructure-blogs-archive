<meta name="description" content="On Sep, 21st we have released Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7. Since then we had 1.6 million download requests. And this is only for the newest release. There are more for other versions that the users download due to their special needs. And not included are the many others from news magazins - online or on CD/DVD. Another impressive number is: 294 million. These are the downloads over all versions since 01st January, 2012. Also with this post we want to call your attention again to 2 important things: We strongly advise to download software only from its original source. Then you are on the safe side to avoid any viruses or malware. For Apache OpenOffice it is &quot;https://www.openoffice.org/download/&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; You don&#39;t need a permission or even registration to use or copy Apache OpenOffice as it is free and open source software. So, no problem with license keys and fees and other restricting stuff that is wasting your lifetime." />
