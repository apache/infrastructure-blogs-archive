<meta name="description" content="The Apache Software Foundation, in conjunction with our friends at the Linux Foundation events team, are proud to announce the schedule for ApacheCon North America - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/program/schedule&nbsp;-&nbsp;and Apache Big Data North America - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america/program/schedule Since 1999, The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has been recognized as a leading source for Open Source software and tools that meet the demand for interoperable, adaptable, and sustainable solutions. The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates dozens of enterprise-grade Open Source projects that power mission-critical applications in financial services, aerospace, publishing, government, healthcare, research, infrastructure, and more. From Abdera to ZooKeeper, the ASF&#39;s reliable, community-driven software continues to grow dramatically across many categories, including Cloud, IoT and Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, Mobile, and Big Data, where the Apache Hadoop ecosystem dominates the marketplace. Today, many of the ASF&rsquo;s 300+ projects serve as the backbone for some of the world&rsquo;s most visible and widely used applications in Big Data (Cassandra, Hadoop, Spark); Cloud (CouchDB, CloudStack, Mesos); Search and CMS (Derby, Jackrabbit, Lucene/Solr); DevOps and Build Management (Ant, Buildr, Maven); Web Frameworks (Flex, OFBiz, Struts); Servers (HTTP Web Server, Tomcat, Traffic Server); among others. Come to ApacheCon to learn about tomorrow&#39;s software, today. Find out what&#39;s coming next out of the Apache Incubator that will change the world again. Meet the people that make it happen, and get in on the ground floor of the next wave of innovation. ApacheCon North America and ApacheCon Big Data will be held at the Miami Intercontinental, May 16th through 18th, 2017. Come early for the Apache Traffic Server and Apache Traffic Control Summit. ATS and ATC are the workhorses behind some of the largest websites in the world. The summit will be happening on Sunday, May 14, and May 15, before the main conference. Find out details about this event at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/extend-the-experience/ats-summit And on Monday, May 15, we&#39;ll be holding the BarCampApache event, a full-day, unconference style event, where many of the ideas behind Apache projects have been hatched in the past. Details are at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/extend-the-experience/barcamp Early bird pricing for ApacheCon ends on Sunday, so register today to save $200. Register for ApacheCon North America at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/attend/register- or for Apache Big Data at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america/attend/register- &nbsp;But note that a ticket for the one also gives you full access to the other event.
