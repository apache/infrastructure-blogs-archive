    <p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) has confirmed today that the Groovy dynamic object-oriented programming language has formally submitted itself to the Apache Incubator in order to become part of the Foundation's efforts. [1]</p> 
    <p>The incubation of Groovy is the first step to becoming an ASF Top-Level Project. The Groovy community will join more than 350 Open Source initiatives overseen by the ASF --including 35 projects in the Apache Incubator-- and will benefit from the Foundation's widely-emulated community-driven process, stewardship, infrastructure, outreach, and events.</p> 
  </div> 
  <p>&quot;We are happy to welcome Groovy to the Apache Incubator,&quot; said ASF Vice Chairman Greg Stein. &quot;Groovy has a diverse and active community that will find 'The Apache Way' of meritocratic development a perfect complement to their existing recognition of the value and benefits of the Apache License, under which their code is released. The ASF's proven framework will offer Groovy the organizational, legal, financial, and infrastructure support needed to continue to be available to its established user base and millions of developers worldwide.&quot;</p> 
  <div> 
    <p>The Apache Incubator is the entry path into The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join Apache enter through the Incubator. Since its creation in 2002, the Apache Incubator has mentored 220 projects: 148 have graduated as Apache Top-level Projects, 35 are currently under incubation, and 37 were retired. Further information on the Apache Incubator is available at <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">http://incubator.apache.org/</a>.</p>

    <p>&quot;After seeing (Apache Member and Groovy creator) James Strachan's Groovy talk at OSCON in 2004, I find it wonderful serendipity to see it arrive at the Foundation a decade later,&quot; added Stein.</p>
