The client transmits the event to it&rsquo;s next hop destination. This destination is an agent. More precisely, the destination is a source operating within the agent. The source receiving this event will then deliver it to one or more channels. The channels that receive the event are drained by one or more sinks operating within the same agent. If the sink is a regular sink, it will forward the event to it&rsquo;s next-hop destination which will be another agent. If instead it is a terminal sink, it will forward the event to it&rsquo;s final destination. Channels allow the decoupling of sources from sinks using the familiar producer-consumer model of data exchange. This allows sources and sinks to have different performance and runtime characteristics and yet be able to effectively use the physical resources available to the system. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "></span><br />

<div style="background-color: transparent; ">

When a message moves from one agent to another, two transactions are started, one on the agent that delivers the event and the other on the agent that receives the event. In order for the sending agent to commit it&rsquo;s transaction, it must receive success indication from the receiving agent. The receiving agent only returns a success indication if it&rsquo;s own transaction commits properly first. This ensures guaranteed delivery semantics between the hops that the flow makes. Figure 3 below shows a sequence diagram that illustrates the relative scope and duration of the transactions operating within the two interacting agents.</span></p>

When a flow that passes through many different agents encounters a communication failure on any leg of the flow, the affected events start getting buffered at the last unaffected agent in the flow. If the failure is not resolved on time, this may lead to the failure of the last unaffected agent, which then would force the agent before it to start buffering the events. Eventually if the failure occurs when the client transmits the event to its first-hop destination, the failure will be reported back to the client which can then allow the application generating the events to take appropriate action.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "></span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; ">On the other hand, if the failure is resolved before the first-hop agent fails, the buffered events in various agents downstream will start draining towards their destination. Eventually the flow will be restored to its original characteristic throughput levels. Figure 4 below illustrates a scenario where a flow comprising of two intermediary agents between the client and the central store go through a transient failure. The failure occurs between agent 2 and the central store, resulting in the events getting buffered at the agent 2 itself. Once the failing link has been restored to normal, the buffered events drain out to the central store and the flow is restored to its original throughput characteristics.</span></p>
