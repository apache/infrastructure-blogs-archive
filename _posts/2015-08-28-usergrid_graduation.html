<p>
We are happy and proud to announce that <b>Apache Usergrid has graduated from the Apache Incubator</b> and we are now an <a href="https://github.com/apache/usergrid/blob/master/tlp-resolution.txt">official &ldquo;top-level&rdquo; project</a> of the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>
Usergrid has been an open source project since 2011 and has been used in production for many customers over the years since then, but now, we&rsquo;ve gone through the Apache Incubator, learned the Apache Way, grown our community, made three Incubator approved<br />
<a href="http://usergrid.apache.org/releases/">releases</a> and made huge progress on development of a new persistence & indexing engine for the yet-to-be released Usergrid 2 &mdash; more about that later.</p>
<p>
We're ready to stand on our own an ASF project and  and like every Apache project, we welcome all contributors. We&rsquo;ve got lots of work to do. If you&rsquo;d like to help out, please join us on our<br />
<a href="http://usergrid.apache.org/community">mailing lists</a> and in our<br />
<a href="https://www.hipchat.com/gDDIQrdQa">HipChat room</a>.</p>
<p>Usergrid, over and out...</p>
