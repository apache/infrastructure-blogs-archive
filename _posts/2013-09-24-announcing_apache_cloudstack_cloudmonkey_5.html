<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the immediate availability<br />
of the Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey 5.0.0 release.</p>
<p>Apache CloudStack's CloudMonkey is a Python-based command line utility for<br />
interacting with Apache CloudStack IaaS clouds.  The software provides<br />
an interactive shell environment that includes command discovery,<br />
auto-completion and multiple output formats. CloudMonkey can also be<br />
used as a simple command line utility, which can be easily integrated<br />
into larger shell scripts.</p>
<p>This is the first independently released version of CloudMonkey provided<br />
by the Apache CloudStack project community.  This release includes<br />
pre-cached API command syntax for Apache CloudStack versions up to<br />
and including CloudStack 4.2.0.</p>
<p>The release can be obtained from the CloudMonkey section of the Apache<br />
CloudStack download page:</p>

<p>Additionally, the 5.0.0 release is available via the Python Package<br />
Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudmonkey) and may be installed<br />
via pip. Further instructions may be found on the Apache CloudStack<br />
