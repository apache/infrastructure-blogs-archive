<p>As the Apache OpenOffice project gets closer to our big 4.0 release we're ramping up our documentation team.&nbsp; The goal is to have new User Guides ready for the OpenOffice 4.0 launch.&nbsp; If you know something about technical writing, or OpenOffice, or ideally both, we'd love your help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of all the opportunities you have to volunteer your time for worthy causes, why should you consider volunteering with the Apache OpenOffice documentation team?&nbsp; A few thoughts on that: </p>
<ul>
<li>We're a fun, international group of volunteers, with a range of<br />
skills and experience, dedicated to free software and spreading the word<br />
 about OpenOffice.</li>
<li>Helping with documentation is a good way to "give back" to the open<br />
source community, something that can be done without requiring special<br />
technical skills or large time commitments.</li>
<li>Contributions are needed from volunteers with a range of experience levels and<br />
interests.  From authoring, to editing, technical verification, proof-reading, graphic design and tooling, we need volunteers in many disciplines.</li>
<li>This is a good way to learn more about technical writing and gain practical experience.</li>
<li>OpenOffice is among the most recognized open source brands, up there with Linux, Android and Firefox.  Your<br />
contributions to our efforts will potentially be seen by millions of users.</li>
</ul>
