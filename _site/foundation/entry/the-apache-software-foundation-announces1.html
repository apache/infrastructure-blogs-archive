<meta name="description" content="Intelligent Big Data monitoring and alerting solution in use at high volume, high demand Websites, platforms, and organizations such as eBay, PayPal, Dataguise, and YHD.com, among others. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;10 January 2017&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Eagle&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. Apache Eagle is an Open Source monitoring and alerting solution for instantly identifying security and performance issues on Big Data platforms such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and more. &quot;We are proud to complete the incubation process and graduate as an Apache Top-Level Project,&quot; said Edward Zhang, Vice President of Apache Eagle. &quot;The community is actively improving product coverage for analyzing various performance and security issues in large Hadoop clusters.&quot; Eagle was first developed at eBay to solve the monitoring problem for a large scale Hadoop cluster. The eBay team soon realized it would be useful to the whole community, and submitted the project to the Apache Incubator in October 2015. Since then, the project gained a lot of attraction from various developers and organizations for its broad usage scenarios, such as system/service monitoring, application performance monitoring, and security breach detection. Apache Eagle features include: Highly extensible - Apache Eagle builds its core framework around the application concept; the application itself includes the logic for monitoring source data collection, pre-processing and normalization. Developers can easily develop out-of-box monitoring applications using Eagle&#39;s application framework, and deploy into Eagle. Scalable - the project&rsquo;s fundamental runtime is based on proven Big Data technologies, and applies a scalable core to make it adaptive according to the throughput of the data stream as well as the number of monitored applications. Real-time - provides state-of-the-art alert engine to identify security breaches and performance issues. Dynamic - users can freely enable or disable a monitoring application and dynamically change their alert policies without any impact to the underlying runtime. &quot;It is exciting to see increasing deployments of Apache Eagle, along with great use cases and contributions back to the project,&quot; added Zhang. &quot;Apache Eagle is a highly scalable and extensible technology platform to support the ever growing needs of intelligent monitoring and alerting in a massively distributed computing environment,&quot; said Debashis Saha, CTO and EVP at Jiff Inc. &quot;As the founding executive sponsor of this project at eBay, I am proud to see the community continue to expand the capabilities by supporting complex and diverse use cases for monitoring in security, infrastructure, networking and distributed services in Apache Eagle. Congratulations to the team and the community in graduating to a Apache top level project.&quot; &quot;As a leader in data-centric security with a focus on cloud and Big Data technologies, Dataguise is proud to be part of the Eagle committers group. DgSecure Monitor, our sensitivity-aware monitoring product, uses Apache Eagle as the core engine,&quot; said Subra Ramesh, VP of Products and Engineering at Dataguise Inc. &quot;Apache Eagle&#39;s flexible architecture, proven scalability, and &nbsp;cutting-edge design, have enabled DgSecure Monitor to be a highly responsive and scalable solution for both on-premises and cloud deployments. We look forward to continued involvement with Eagle as it has now become a top-level Apache project.&quot; &quot;We have been using Apache Eagle for about a year, and are very happy to see it graduate to a Top-Level Project. Apache Eagle and its low latency real-time alert engine can help us easily identify security and performance issues instantly on Hadoop platform,&quot; said Anson Zhong, Senior Vice President of Tech Department at YHD.com. &quot;In addition, Eagle&#39;s architecture is highly extensible. We are looking forward to using it in real time risk management system.&quot; &quot;Apache Eagle is a great monitoring and alerting solution designed for large-scale distributed environment,&quot; said Chad Chun, Director of Analytics Data Infrastructure at eBay. &quot;It was originally intended for security monitoring and quickly become a generic solution for allowing domain experts to create their own monitoring applications on top of Eagle. This is a wonderful design for easily leveraging the power of community to create and share applications. Looking forward to the tremendous adoption in the industry.&quot; &quot;The Apache Eagle community has done a tremendous job throughout the incubation process, and I&#39;m thrilled to see it graduate to a Top-Level Project,&quot; said P. Taylor Goetz, ASF Member and Apache Eagle Project Mangement Committee member. &quot;Eagle fills a very important role in providing top-notch security and performance monitoring and alerting for Big Data deployments. The Eagle project has built a robust, sustainable community and demonstrated a firm understanding of the Apache Way. I look forward to further innovation as the Eagle community marks this important milestone.&quot; &quot;It is great to see Apache Eagle graduate to a Top Level Project within a year of time,&quot; said Seshu Adunuthula, Senior Director of Data Platforms at eBay. &quot;It is a great product with unique position to fill the gap of monitoring and alerting large-scale distributed computing environment which is well architected to allow communities to easily implement monitoring and alerting applications on different technical domains such as networking and database clusters. &nbsp;I would love to see the community to grow fast in the next coming years!&quot; The project welcomes contributions and community participation through mailing lists, Slack channel, face-to-face Meetups, and other events. &lt;/p&gt; Availability and Oversight Apache Eagle software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&#39;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

About the Apache Incubator The Apache Incubator is the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF. For more information, visit http://incubator.apache.org About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than 350 leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server --the world&#39;s most popular Web server software. Through the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process known as &quot;The Apache Way,&quot; more than 620 individual Members and 5,900 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation&#39;s official user conference, trainings, and expo.

<div><strong>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;10 January 2017&mdash;</strong> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Eagle&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Eagle is an Open Source monitoring and alerting solution for instantly identifying security and performance issues on Big Data platforms such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"We are proud to complete the incubation process and graduate as an Apache Top-Level Project," said Edward Zhang, Vice President of Apache Eagle. "The community is actively improving product coverage for analyzing various performance and security issues in large Hadoop clusters."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Eagle was first developed at eBay to solve the monitoring problem for a large scale Hadoop cluster. The eBay team soon realized it would be useful to the whole community, and submitted the project to the Apache Incubator in October 2015. Since then, the project gained a lot of attraction from various developers and organizations for its broad usage scenarios, such as system/service monitoring, application performance monitoring, and security breach detection.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Eagle features include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Highly extensible - Apache Eagle builds its core framework around the application concept; the application itself includes the logic for monitoring source data collection, pre-processing and normalization. Developers can easily develop out-of-box monitoring applications using Eagle's application framework, and deploy into Eagle.</li>
<li>Scalable - the project&rsquo;s fundamental runtime is based on proven Big Data technologies, and applies a scalable core to make it adaptive according to the throughput of the data stream as well as the number of monitored applications.</li>
<li>Real-time - provides state-of-the-art alert engine to identify security breaches and performance issues.</li>
<li>Dynamic - users can freely enable or disable a monitoring application and dynamically change their alert policies without any impact to the underlying runtime.</li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>"It is exciting to see increasing deployments of Apache Eagle, along with great use cases and contributions back to the project," added Zhang.</div>

<div>"Apache Eagle is a great monitoring and alerting solution designed for large-scale distributed environment," said Chad Chun, Director of Analytics Data Infrastructure at eBay. "It was originally intended for security monitoring and quickly become a generic solution for allowing domain experts to create their own monitoring applications on top of Eagle. This is a wonderful design for easily leveraging the power of community to create and share applications. Looking forward to the tremendous adoption in the industry."</div>

<div>"The Apache Eagle community has done a tremendous job throughout the incubation process, and I'm thrilled to see it graduate to a Top-Level Project," said P. Taylor Goetz, ASF Member and Apache Eagle Project Mangement Committee member. "Eagle fills a very important role in providing top-notch security and performance monitoring and alerting for Big Data deployments. The Eagle project has built a robust, sustainable community and demonstrated a firm understanding of the Apache Way. I look forward to further innovation as the Eagle community marks this important milestone."</div>

<div><strong>About the Apache Incubator</strong></div>
<div>The Apache Incubator is the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
