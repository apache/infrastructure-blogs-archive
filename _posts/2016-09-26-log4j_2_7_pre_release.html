<h3>Scala API</h3>
<p>Log4j 2.7 includes a <tt>Logging</tt> trait that removes some boilerplate code. Your Scala code can now look like this:</p>
<pre>
import org.apache.logging.log4j.scala.Logging
 
class MyClass extends BaseClass with Logging {
  def doStuff(): Unit = {
    logger.info("Doing stuff")
  }
}</pre>
<p>This also enables a more compact form of parameterized logging. Instead of the common Java form:</p>
<pre>
logger.debug("Logging in user {} with birthday {}", user.getName(), user.calcBirthday());
</pre>
<p>In Scala, you can use <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html>string interpolation</a> to achieve this:</p>
<pre>
logger.debug(s"Logging in user ${user.getName} with birthday ${user.calcBirthday}")
</pre>
<h3>Non-Blocking Queues in Async Appender</h3>
<p>In addition to Log4j 2's <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html">Asynchronous Loggers</a>, which are based on the LMAX Disruptor library, the 2.7 release allows you to configure the Async Appender to use a different queue implementation, including a few non-blocking ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>ArrayBlockingQueue - This is the default implementation that uses <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ArrayBlockingQueue.html">ArrayBlockingQueue</a></li>
<li>LinkedTransferQueue - This uses the JDK <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedTransferQueue.html">LinkedTransferQueue</a> which was introduced in Java 7.</li>
<li>JCToolsBlockingQueue - This uses the <abbr title="multiple producer single consumer">MPSC</abbr> bounded lock-free queue in <a href="https://jctools.github.io/JCTools/">JCTools</a>.</li>
<li>DisruptorBlockingQueue - This uses the <a href="https://github.com/conversant/disruptor">Conversant Disruptor</a> BlockingQueue. (Not to be confused with the LMAX Disruptor.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Custom Context Data Injection</h3>
<p>Context data is data that is set by the application to be included in all subsequent log events. The default source for context data is the <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/thread-context.html">ThreadContext</a>.</p>
<p>
From Log4j 2.7, users can configure a custom <tt>ContextDataInjector</tt> that can </p>
<ul>
<li>take context data from any source, and</li>
<li>use values of any type (not just Strings).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the <tt>ThreadContext</tt> map is now garbage-free. This is disabled by default, users need to enable this explicitly.</p>
<h3>...and much more</h3>
<p>RoutingAppender can now be configured with scripts, a new ScriptAppenderSelector was introduced that creates an Appender specified by a Script, FileAppender (and its Rolling equivalent) can now create files on-demand, and there are various other improvements.</p>
