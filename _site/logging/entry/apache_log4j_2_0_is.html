<meta name="description" content="Apache Log4J logo contest Log4j 2.0 is looking for a new logo! After 12 years, the Log4j project is getting ready for a brand new major release: version 2.0. This new major version is a reboot of this project in many ways: it is not only time to change the version number to 2.0 but also time to refresh the Log4j logo. Log4j 2 is very different from Log4j 1. Log4j 2 is more reliable and faster than its predecessor and comparable frameworks. The team has grown after years of stagnation and there is now a lot of activity on our lists. We are now approaching the 2.0 release after eight beta releases. With our new logo, we want to show the Java community that Log4j is back. We would like to open participation to the community to create this new logo. HOW TO PARTICIPATE Attach your entries to the Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-316 You can submit as many entries as you like. You must license your Logo under the Apache License 2.0. The contest will last one month from the date of the announcement. If your Logo is accepted, you must sign an ICLA: http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt While we will accept PNG image formats for the contest, we prefer vector based formats (SVG). You can convert pixel-based formats produced with Gimp or Photoshop to SVG with free tools like Inkscape (http://inkscape.org) Please note that a logo should not contain too many details. HOW THE WINNING LOGO IS CHOSEN We invite everyone to vote on the mailing lists. The votes of Apache Logging Committers are binding. If the community submits more than 10 Logos, voting will proceed in two rounds. In the first round, the 10 logos with the most +1 votes graduate to round two. In the second round, the logo with the most +1 will win the contest. The majority of the Apache Logging PMC can veto a logo. We will accept the logo when all votes are successful and the ICLA of the logo contributor is on file. Please ask questions on the dev mailing list. The Log4j team" />
