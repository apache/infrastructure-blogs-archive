<h3 id="cluster-profiling">Cluster Profiling</h3>
<p>From now on, Apache Ignite is delivered with the cluster profiling tool. This tool collects and processes all cluster<br />
    internal information about Queries, Compute Tasks, Cache operations, Checkpoint and WAL statistics, and so on for<br />
    problem detection and cluster self-tuning purposes. Each cluster node collects performance statistics into a special<br />
    binary file that is placed under the <code>[IGINTE_WORK_DIR]/perf_stat/</code> directory with the template filename<br />
    as<br />
    <code>node-[nodeId]-[index].prf</code>.<br />
    All these files are consumed by offline-tool that builds the report in a human-readable format.</p>

<h3 id="transparent-data-encryption-cache-key-rotation">Transparent Data Encryption - Cache Key Rotation</h3>
<p>Payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) requires that key-management procedures include a predefined<br />
    crypto period for each key in use and define a process for key changes at the end of the defined crypto period.<br />
    An expired key should not be used to encrypt new data, but it can be used for archived data, such keys should be<br />
    strongly protected (section 3.5 - 3.6 of PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures).</p>
<p>Apache Ignite now supports full PCI DSS requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Transparent Data Encryption</em> available since the 2.7 release.</li>
<li><em>Master Key Rotation</em> procedure available since the 2.9 release.</li>
<li><em>Cache Key Rotation</em> procedure available since the 2.10 release.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may use the CLI tools that provide the ability to change the re-encryption rate as well as suspend and<br />
    resume background re-encryption at runtime.</p>
