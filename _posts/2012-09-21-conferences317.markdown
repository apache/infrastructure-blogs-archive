<p><i><b>Developer-focused
 Community Edition explores key Open Source applications and issues, 
from Big Data and Smart Search to Cloud and Infrastructure. </b></i><br /><br />Forest
 Hill, MD –21 September 2012– The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the 
all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open 
Source projects and initiatives, today announced the program for 
ApacheCon, its official conference.<br /><br />Apache products power 
half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of operations, billions 
of objects, and enhance the lives of countless users and developers. 
ApacheCon brings developers and users together to explore key issues in 
building Open Source solutions &quot;The Apache Way&quot;.<br /><br />ApacheCon 
returns to Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in 
Sinsheim, Germany, attracting Open Source users, developers, 
gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts to the newly-introduced 
&quot;Community Edition&quot; of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at
 a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring an array of 
sessions focused on Apache projects and initiatives, plus MeetUps, 
FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. This is an 
ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based 
solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache 
project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open 
Source products and community practices.<br /><br />ApacheCon Europe 
Community Edition is organized and run by the Apache community with 
assistance from The Open Bastion, producers of ApacheCon North America 
2013. In keeping with the community-driven culture of the ASF, all
