  content: "Guys, we use Flex /AIR in combination with Granite Data Services, which
    provides for a real time user experience, very very powerful. \r\n\r\nThese guys
    seem to have stopped development however but this could be a really valuable addition
    to the SDK and turn it into a real time cross-platform apps development platform.
    The code is at https://github.com/graniteds and the main developer is https://github.com/wdrai
    .\r\n\r\nCheers and keep up the good work! \r\nPaulus."
