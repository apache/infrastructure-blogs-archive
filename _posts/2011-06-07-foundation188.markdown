<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) will be holding its annual Members' meeting this July. Among the Foundation's business that takes place during this meeting is the election of new ASF Members.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>At its inception in 1999, The ASF comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP&nbsp;Server. This group formed the Foundation's core membership.&nbsp;This group grew with &quot;Committers&quot;, developers who&nbsp;contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership: 1) to&nbsp;&quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; (contribute) directly to the code repository; 2) the right to vote on community-related decisions; and 3) and the&nbsp;ability propose an active user for Committership. Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundationâ€™s growth,&nbsp;evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing members.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p> ASF Members are elected bi-annually. New <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html" title="ASF Members">Members</a>&nbsp;elected at the January 2011 Members' meeting are:</p>
