The official conference, trainings, and expo of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) will return to Atlanta this November, with dozens of sessions on Servers, Cloud Computing, Search, NoSQL, Incubating projects, innovations, emerging technologies, and more. ApacheCon&#39;s technical tracks are currently being planned by their respective Project Management Committees and will be announced in the upcoming weeks. Over the past five years, the ApacheCon Business/Community Track brought some of the most compelling non-technical topics in Open Source, bridging user, developer, and deployment issues as they relate to customer and community success. We are soliciting 50-minute presentations for the Business/Community Track at the next conference, 1-5 November 2010, at the Westin Peachtree in Atlanta. The ASF&#39;s meritocratic process known as &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, is widely credited for the success of many leading Open Source projects and communities.
