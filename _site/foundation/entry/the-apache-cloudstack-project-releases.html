Wilmington, DE &mdash;19 January 2021&mdash; The Apache CloudStack Project announced today v4.15 of Apache&reg; CloudStack&reg;, the mature, turnkey Open Source enterprise Cloud orchestration platform. Apache CloudStack is the proven, highly scalable IaaS platform of choice to rapidly and easily create private, public, and hybrid Cloud environments: it &quot;just works&quot;. Apache CloudStack powers mission-critical clouds for the world&rsquo;s largest users and service providers, including Alcatel-Lucent, Apple, Autodesk, Bell Canada, BT, China Telecom, Dell, Disney, Fujitsu, Huawei, INRIA, Juniper Networks, Korea Telecom, Leaseweb, Melbourne University, Nokia, NTT, Orange, SAP, Schuberg Philis, Taiwan Mobile, Tata, TrendMicro, Verizon, WebMD, and countless others. &quot;We are pleased to announce our latest release, making CloudStack even easier to deploy full-featured public and private clouds,&quot; said Sven Vogel, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. &quot;Apache CloudStack continues to grow from strength to strength, with upgraded software and powerful deployments, backed by a robust community.&quot; Apache CloudStack v4.15Apache CloudStack includes the entire &quot;stack&quot; of features in an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration, Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, full and open native API, resource accounting, and a first-class user interface. The new 4.15 release ships with more than 200 new features, improvements, and bug fixes that include: A new, modern user interface at general availability vSphere advanced storage capabilities to support VMware storage policies, vSAN, VMFS6, vVols and datastore clusters VMware &quot;deploy-as-is&quot; templates with OVF properties support for deploying virtual appliances in CloudStack clouds Secondary storage management tools Roles based users in projects Dynamic roles enhancements for more granular RBAC Support for CentOS 8, Ubuntu 20.04, XCP-ng 8.1, and MySQL 8 noVNC console for performance improvements to VM console access Redfish support for out of band management Unmanaging guest VMs PVLAN support for L2 networks Boot into hardware setup (VMware) Configure root disk via service offering The full list of new features is available in the project release notes at https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.15.0.0/releasenotes/about.html &quot;At NTT/Itelligence we were eagerly anticipating this latest version of Apache CloudStack as many of the features in the release are of importance to our Itelligence cloud solution,&quot; said Andre Walter, VP, Head of GMS Cloud Infrastructure Services at Itelligence Global Managed Services GmbH. &quot;We are particularly excited about the vSphere advanced capabilities and full OVF properties support.
