<p>One month has passed since NetBeans 11.2 had been released. There are 82 new PR-s made it to the master branch so far. We usually have a, not necessary intentional, "theme" for each release. I'd say the theme is for 11.3 is: "Remove the Rust".</p>
<p>Our code and libraries spent long time in the transit. Many of our modules were still compiling against Java 1.6 and/or used ancient versions of third party libraries. 11.3 improved a lot on this front and there are still many PR are in the queue to carry that on.<br />
Without trying to be complete, here is a small list of changes what's coming:</p>
<p>- Jgit Library Update<br />
- ASM, PostgreSQL, JUnit5 and Other Library Updates.<br />
- PHP Fixes<br />
- HTML Lexer Stability Improvements<br />
- JSF 2.3 Support<br />
- Gradle Tooling 6.0<br />
- Several Cleanups, Remove Compile Warnings</p>
<p>On the UI Side:<br />
- Return of Dark Metal and Dark Nimbus Look and Feel<br />
- Experimental support for Flatlaf Look and Feel</p>
<p>On Gradle Side:<br />
- Test Output is Channeled Back to the IDE<br />
- Added Project Reload Action<br />
- Elephant Icons Finally Replace the old Ones</p>
