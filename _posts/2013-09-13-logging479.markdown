The Apache log4net team is pleased to announce the release of Apache
log4net 1.2.12.  The release is available for download at

    <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download_log4net.cgi">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download_log4net.cgi</a>

The Apache log4net library is a tool to help the programmer output log
statements to a variety of output targets.  log4net is a port of the
excellent Apache log4j framework to the Microsoft(R) .NET runtime.

log4net 1.2.12 is mostly a bugfix release in which more than thirty JIRA
issues have been resolved.  See

    <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html</a>

for a full list of changes.

The binary distributions no longer contain assemblies built for the
Compact Framework 2.0 - you can build those yourself using the source
distribution.

Please verify signatures using the KEYS file available at the above
location when downloading the release.
