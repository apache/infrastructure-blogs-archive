<li>Are you additionally experienced as lead technical writer?</li>
<li>Do you like to contribute to open source projects?</li>
<li>And are you proficient in written technical English?</li>
</ul>

We will help you get started.</p>
<p>All contributions are welcome and valued. Established contributors have the opportunity to become committers at the Apache Software Foundation, and thus get several benefits and the recognition from other community members for the value of their open source contributions.</p>
