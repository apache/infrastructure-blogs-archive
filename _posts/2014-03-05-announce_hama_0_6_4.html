<p>The Hama team is pleased to announce the Hama 0.6.4 release.</p>
<p>Apache Hama is a pure BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing framework on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for massive scientific computations such as matrix, graph and network algorithms.</p>
<p>This release improves memory usage by 3 times better than before (without significant performance degradation) and adds runtime message compression.</p>
<p>The artifacts are published and ready for you to download[1] either from the Apache mirrors or from the Maven repository. We welcome your help, feedback, and suggestions. For more information on how to report problems, and to get involved, visit the project website[2] and wiki[3].</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
