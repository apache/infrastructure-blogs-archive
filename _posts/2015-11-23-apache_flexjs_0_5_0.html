<p>The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache<br />
FlexJS SDK 0.5.0 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.5.0.</p>
<p>Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for<br />
building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently<br />
on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones,<br />
tablets and tv).</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use<br />
MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the<br />
same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively<br />
in browsers.  The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova<br />
(Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.</p>
<p>Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript<br />
cross-compiler.  It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as<br />
Falcon.  Both are contained in the release package and are used by the<br />
FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS.</p>
<p>This is the third release of FlexJS and FalconJX.  It is &lsquo;beta'<br />
quality.  This release includes some new components, updated integration<br />
with Apache Cordova, a few effect classes, drag and drop support, and an<br />
example that is a port of the old Flex &lsquo;FlexStore' example.</p>
<p>The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the<br />
features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we<br />
grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest<br />
productivity developing applications that can run in the most places.<br />
These releases may not handle production needs.  Expect lots of bugs and<br />
missing features.  Please file bugs at:</p>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX</a></p>
<p>For questions about how to use FlexJS and FalconJX, send email to<br />
<a href="mailto:users@flex.apache.org">users@flex.apache.org</a>.  Please try to prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or<br />
[FalconJX] so it is clear the questions refer to this release and not the<br />
Flex SDK and MXMLC compiler.</p>
<p>For questions and feedback on the development of the source code in these<br />
release, send email to <a href="mailto:dev@flex.apache.org">dev@flex.apache.org</a>.  Again, please prefix the<br />
subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX].</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX are available in source and binary<br />
form from the following download page:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html">http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html</a></p>
<p>When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the<br />
downloads using signatures or MD5 hashes.</p>
<p>A simple way to try these releases is to use the<br />
InstallApacheFlex 3.1 or 3.2 application which is available at the<br />
following url:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/installer.html">http://flex.apache.org/installer.html</a></p>
<p>Choose Apache FlexJS 0.5.0 and it will create an Adobe Flash<br />
Builder-compatible SDK that uses the Falcon and FalconJX compilers to<br />
generate SWFs and HTML/JS/CSS output.  You can also use FDT as your IDE<br />
for developing FlexJS applications.  Some folks have been successful<br />
using IntelliJ as well.</p>
