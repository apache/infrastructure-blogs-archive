&lt;p&gt;The CloudStack Community is happy to announce Rohit Yadav as the new VP of the Apache CloudStack Project and PMC chair. After a year of success in which Simon Weller chaired the project, we are now excited to welcome Rohit, who is a long-term contributor to the project. He has a strong technology background and has been engaged in the open-source world for more than a decade, during which he contributed to multiple other open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview, you will be able to learn more about Rohit Yadav and see his perspective on the VP&apos;s role and how he can contribute to the Apache CloudStack project evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;believe in open-source, where and how did it all start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/e0fac3b3-be00-4d5e-9e8c-0d64d61deb5f&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;163&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; hspace=&quot;20&quot; vspace=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my university days, I got introduced to open-source as a way of community-driven development. Compared to proprietary and closed-source software, I found the idea of open-source remarkable that anybody can access source code, learn it, modify it, distribute it, and even contribute it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my spare time, I started learning and contributing to a few open-source projects as a hobby and even created some open-source side-projects. I also got an opportunity to work with the VideoLAN project as a Google Summer of Code and later worked as a volunteer summer student at CERN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this early experience inculcated an interest in open-source and virtualisation, and eventually, I was hired straight out of university by Citrix to work on open-source Apache CloudStack project that was still in the ASF incubator at the time. This is when I learned about the ASF and how to work in the Apache CloudStack community from my colleagues and from the community, and I learnt how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://infra.apache.org/contributors.html&quot;&gt;contribute changes&lt;/a&gt;. I started lurking and interacting on the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html&quot;&gt;mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; and IRC to understand how to work in this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly found myself supporting users on the mailing lists and learning real-world use of CloudStack, contributing patches such as maintaining our (new) maven-based build system, working on some issues and making some improvements. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey&quot;&gt;wrote the cloudmonkey CLI&lt;/a&gt; because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t one available and I also ended-up working on a large APIs refactoring project that helped me understand CloudStack deeper and work closely with the original creators and architects of CloudStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this, I was invited to become a committer to the project and got sponsored to participate in the first CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2012 in Las Vegas. After another few years of working on flagship CloudStack features, frameworks, releases, maintaining CloudStack and collaborating with the community, I eventually got invited to become a PMC member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned into a more supporting, mentoring, empowering and leadership role in the community and at work. This allows me to find time and bandwidth to champion and promote Apache CloudStack in all forums and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/9e380bde-e7d7-4a2c-8a16-cd0afc413051&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should enterprises use open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-source&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;solutions? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprises nowadays are adopting open-source software especially when it comes to infrastructure software. This gives them business advantage in keeping low costs and not having to depend on a single vendor (no vendor lock-in) while have the longevity, trust, stability, reliability, durability, flexibility, better agility and security, and access to an ecosystem of community and commercial offerings and support around it. There is also community and inter-organisation collaborations on standards, frameworks and feature development that help reduce costs for the end-consumers, including the enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprises also attract better talent as it&amp;rsquo;s generally much easy to hire or train talent on open-source software with its documentation and other types of training materials in the form of books, blogs and videos etc., accessible to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine any enterprise and any consumer product or service that won&amp;rsquo;t have any open-source project used in their stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the existing enterprise users of Apache CloudStack and how are they benefiting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody looking to implement (private or public) IaaS cloud should seriously consider CloudStack. It is easy to-use, cost-effective, very stable, massively scalable, highly reliable battle-tested IaaS cloud computing platform, well-known and used in production at many of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest organisations. The project is community-driven by diverse contributors who are deeply invested in solving real-world &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies&quot;&gt;use-cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to take my word for it - as an open-source top-level &lt;a href=&quot;https://apache.org/&quot;&gt;ASF&lt;/a&gt; project anybody can test drive and see it for themselves, there is no vendor lock-in or paywall to get started. It takes a very short amount of time and effort to set it up, perhaps a few hours or less for a seasoned administrator. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/quickinstallationguide/qig.html&quot;&gt;quick install guides&lt;/a&gt; for anybody to get started and even a public simulator-based demo environment for anybody with a few minutes to try it out, get the look-and-feel for it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/&quot;&gt;https://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/&lt;/a&gt; using the demo-environment credentials admin:password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudStack is very easy to deploy, use and manage. Being a monolith application, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to upgrade, can be managed by a small team. It is feature-rich, and offers a great UI, APIs and rich tooling and libraries such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey&quot;&gt;cloudmonkey&lt;/a&gt; (cmk, the official CLI), the CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-terraform-provider&quot;&gt;Terraform provider&lt;/a&gt;, the CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider&quot;&gt;Kubernetes provider&lt;/a&gt;, the CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://cluster-api-cloudstack.sigs.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;Cluster-API Provider (CAPC)&lt;/a&gt;, the CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-go&quot;&gt;Go-SDK&lt;/a&gt;, support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_cloudstack.html&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;, and countless other integration, libraries and related projects in its ever-growing ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open-source project, Apache CloudStack project does not track who uses it. Still, we have a fair idea of our user base based on the community-maintained and contributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudstack.apache.org/users.html&quot;&gt;list of users&lt;/a&gt; on our project website. Also, based on activities and representation by such users and their organisations in the community by their participation on the mailing lists, around releases, issue reporting and code contributions on Github, attendance and participation in project meetups and conferences, and other forums such as blogs, videos, websites, press releases, social media etc. These enterprises, organisations and users include some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get super motivated and content when I read CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies&quot;&gt;case-studies&lt;/a&gt; or when I learn where and how our work on CloudStack benefits the core mission of companies. In the most recent CloudStack Collab conference, I was delighted to learn how CloudStack &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2LVY18GU8&quot;&gt;empowers the Digital India&lt;/a&gt; mission that helped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cowin.gov.in/&quot;&gt;vaccinate billions&lt;/a&gt; as well as delivers digital product and services to citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Apache CloudStack project evolving and where do you see its future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a steady stream of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;developer contribution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases&quot;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re seeing CloudStack getting more and more polished with every release. We&amp;rsquo;ve grown into a pedigree of PMC members, committers, contributors and power users who have been around in the community for a long time, a decade or more now. This demonstrates the reliability, durability and stability the project offers to the users community and the trust of the users community who are continuing to use and support CloudStack over the years. We&amp;rsquo;re seeing CloudStack adoption growing steadily from users participation on mailing lists, Github, meetups and conferences and release adoption. Per the hype curve, we&amp;rsquo;re in the plateau of productivity so this isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have always been a community-driven project and that should continue. We may also see interesting integrations, features and other changes to align with the changing themes and trends of the industry and the users community, we may find such use-cases in AI, data sovereignty, privacy and cloud-repatriation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure there&amp;rsquo;s a healthy community that feels welcome to use CloudStack, report issues, participate on the mailing lists and in meetups and conferences, and tell us about their use-cases and problems in all such forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users community should be supported to contribute to CloudStack, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook&quot;&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; on CloudStack, help contribute fixes, enhancements and feature that solves their problems, and invite them to become committers and PMC members of the project. As long we support a healthy feedback loop and maintain the cycle of the project it will continue to grow, evolve, and thrive. We also need more efforts towards project marketing and promotion, and some work on strategic features, frameworks and integrations that leads to more growth and adoption of CloudStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start contributing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The provider is available under the Apache 2 open-source license and is managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The Cluster API brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose Apache CloudStack &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache CloudStack helps cloud builders solve their key challenges &amp;ndash; costs, vendor lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical servers installed in geographically distributed data centers. The turnkey solution, made for cloud builders and managed service providers, is open-source and easy to implement, manage and scale - particularly when compared to alternative cloud orchestration platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: xx-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose Apache CloudStack If You Are A Cloud Builder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem that many businesses face when entering the public cloud market is finding the suitable software and partners which enable a rapid deployment for their customers. Often, it takes up a significant number of resources and can have a negative financial impact on the company if the wrong decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudStack is a turnkey solution for cloud builders and manages service providers. It is completely open-source, easy to implement, manage and scale. Powered by a large open-source community and following rapid release cycles, Apache CloudStack help cloud builders solve their key challenges &amp;ndash; costs, vendor lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical servers installed in geographically distributed data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: xx-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Attend CloudFest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: xx-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sessions Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFest Day 2 started with an agenda full of interesting talks from leading cloud providers and companies developing solutions for the industry. Part of the talks, which we found interesting are Distributed Cloud Computing: A New Approach by Akamai, The Resilient Hard Disk Drive (1984 to 2062) by Toshiba, Scalable Edge Data Centers: Current Challenges and How to Overcome Them by german Edge Cloud, a panel discussion on Building Sustainable Data Centers and Making Multicloud Happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will be visiting CloudFest, be sure you stop at the CloudStack booth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Delivering cloud solutions need not be as complex and costly as some would have thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements, as proIO discovered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proIO&lt;/a&gt; was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Br&amp;uuml;seke explains. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts, providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth day-to-day running of operations.&amp;rdquo;, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Swen Br&amp;uuml;seke, CEO of proIO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The company started by remotely looking after its customer&amp;rsquo;s physical servers and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/3e00b9f9-a6a1-482f-972f-1b8f2819d4d9&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #70A7C5; color: white; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none; text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;А Move to CloudStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as Swen explained. &amp;ldquo;We had used it for several years on various other projects, and so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Currently, more than 95% of proIO&amp;rsquo;s virtual machines are Linux based. &amp;ldquo;Our customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or not,&amp;rdquo; explained Swen. &amp;ldquo;They just want their apps to run to support their business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/3e00b9f9-a6a1-482f-972f-1b8f2819d4d9&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #70A7C5; color: white; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none; text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community, contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.&amp;rdquo;, says &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Swen Br&amp;uuml;seke, CEO of proIO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Ivet Petrova&quot;, &quot;login&quot;=&gt;&quot;ivet&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;ivet@apache.org&quot;}</name><email>ivet@apache.org</email></author><category term="Case Studies &amp; Integrations" /><summary type="html">Delivering cloud solutions need not be as complex and costly as some would have thought.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://your.online/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Your.Online&lt;/a&gt; is a team of pioneers from all over the world united by the passion for helping businesses succeed online. Their teams of local experts provide highly standardized managed services to high-intent customers to reach their full online potential. The group serves over 1 million customers and generates &amp;euro;175m in revenue with its eight brands and 600 employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your.Online needed to build a centralized IaaS cloud platform for four of their brands - Versio, Yourhosting, Savvii and Axarnet. The four companies ran on different infrastructure platforms using technologies like VMware, RHEV, Xen server, Virtuozzo, Proxmox, custom-built solutions and many others. This made it extremely hard and nearly impossible to manage their infrastructure centrally and ensure reliability and operational effectiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/d9f0bb38-580a-411c-9318-b1a11143e881&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #70A7C5; color: white; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none; text-transform: uppercase;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph, TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack&amp;rsquo;s Advanced networking model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/85db8d29-cf32-409b-b3b2-1d23df9f598d&quot; alt=&quot;Wido.png width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensuring Reliability in the Long Term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects - usually licensing and governance problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wido den Hollander, CTO, Your.Online&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
