<div>It's traditional. We wait for the last minute to get our talk proposals in for conferences.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, the last minute has arrived. The CFP for ApacheCon Seville closes on September 9th, which is less than 2 weeks away. It's time to get your talks in, so that we can make this the best ApacheCon yet.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It's also time to discuss with your developer and user community whether there's a track of talks that you might want to propose, so that you have more complete coverage of your project than a talk or two.</div>

<div>For Apache Big Data, the relevant URLs are:</div>

<div>This year, we'll be reviewing papers "blind" - that is, looking at the abstracts without knowing who the speaker is. This has been shown to eliminate the "me and my buddies" nature of many tech conferences, producing more diversity, and more new speakers. So make sure your abstracts clearly explain what you'll be talking about.</div>
