<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News January 2016 Happy New Year! We have a double set of news this month covering both December and January, including our Apache birthday, details about our Community Day, FOSDEM and the very sad news of the death of Adrian Crum, a key member of our community. Happy Birthday Apache OFBiz ! In December OFBiz celebrated it&#39;s 9th Apache birthday. On 20th December 2006, OFBiz graduated from incubation and became an Apache Top Level Project. Since then the project has continued to grow and develop. The project now has 30 committers and very active mailing lists for users and developers.Over the 9 years the project has released a range of OFBiz versions from versions 4.0 through to 13.07 and is currently preparing for the next release. December Community Day Our final Community Day for 2015 was held on 19th December. Although close to the festive season, community members still gave up some of their time to collaborate and work on the project. The key tasks were working through the list of task we have open on Jira and applying previously submitted patches. A big thank you goes out to all those who partcipated and a total 13 issues were closed. Our Community Days have been very popular so we have decided to continue them for 2016. Dates have been set as : Q1 - Saturday 19th March 2016 Q2 - Saturday 18th June 2016 Q3 - Saturday 17th September 2016 Q4 - Saturday 17th December 2016 Please add them to your diary if you are interested in participating. Adrian Crum On 1st January 2016, OFBiz Committer and ex PMC member Adrian Crum passed away. His loss is strongly felt within the community and we have had many messages of sympathy and support. Adrian joined the OFBiz project during the incubation phase and in 2007 was invited to become a committer. Later that year Adrian joined the OFBiz PMC and participated until June 2014. Over the years Adrian contributed around 5,000 postings to the mailing lists, over 2,300 issues and comments to issues and over 2,000 commits. Adrian also adopted the abandoned Apache Commons Convert project in April 2010, and made it the home of a Java data-type conversion framework he developed for Apache OFBiz. The project has setup a memorial page for the community to share their stories, and experiences of Adrian. The community has also decided to dedicate our next OFBiz release to him. The whole OFBiz Community sends its condolences to Adrian&#39;s family and friends. FOSDEM 2016 During January, some of our OFBiz community members attended FOSDEM, an open source conference for developers. It was held in Brussels and OFBiz community members from France, The Netherlands, Czech Republic and Belgium came along for conference as well as an informal meetup. The project was allocated a timeslot on the ASF booth to promote OFBiz. With reportedly over 7000 attendees, there were lots of presentations, tutorials and devrooms to choose from. The ASF is planning to have a regular presence at FOSDEM in the future, so it is hoped that we can repeat the meetup and project promotion next year. Please see below for the list of January changes for the OFBiz project.

<p>Happy New Year! </p>
<p>We have a double set of news this month covering both December and January, including our Apache birthday, details about our Community Day, FOSDEM and the very sad news of the death of Adrian Crum, a key member of our community.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Happy Birthday Apache OFBiz !</h2>
<p>In December OFBiz celebrated it's 9th Apache birthday. </p>
<p>On 20th December 2006, OFBiz graduated from incubation and became an Apache Top Level Project.  Since then the project has continued to grow and develop. The project now has 30 committers and very active mailing lists for users and developers.Over the 9 years the project has released a range of OFBiz versions from versions 4.0 through to 13.07 and is currently preparing for the next release. </p>
<h2>December Community Day</h2>
<p>Our final Community Day for 2015 was held on 19th December. Although close to the festive season, community members still gave up some of their time to collaborate and work on the project. The key tasks were working through the list of task we have open on Jira and applying previously submitted patches. A big thank you goes out to all those who partcipated and a total 13 issues were closed.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/OFBiz+Community+Days">Community Days</a>  have been very popular so we have decided to continue them for 2016. Dates have been set as :</p>
<p>   Q1 - Saturday 19th March 2016</p>
<p>   Q2 - Saturday 18th June 2016</p>
<p>    Q3 - Saturday 17th September 2016</p>
<p>    Q4 - Saturday 17th December  2016 </p>
<p>Please add them to your diary if you are interested in participating.</p>
<h2>Adrian Crum</h2>
<p>On 1st January 2016, OFBiz Committer and ex PMC member  <a href="http://www.apache.org/memorials/adrian_crum.html">Adrian Crum</a> passed away. His loss is strongly felt within the community and we have had many messages of sympathy and support. </p>
<p>Adrian joined the OFBiz project during the incubation phase and in 2007 was invited to become a committer. Later that year Adrian joined the OFBiz PMC and participated until June 2014. Over the years Adrian contributed around 5,000 postings to the mailing lists, over 2,300 issues and comments to issues and over 2,000 commits. </p>
<p>Adrian also adopted the abandoned <a href="https://commons.apache.org/sandbox/commons-convert/index.html">Apache Commons Convert</a>  project in April 2010, and made it the home of a Java data-type conversion framework he developed for Apache OFBiz.</p>
<p>The project has setup a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Memorial+-+Adrian+Crum">memorial page</a> for the community to share their stories, and experiences of Adrian.  </p>
<p>The community has also decided to dedicate our next OFBiz release to him. The whole OFBiz Community sends its condolences to Adrian's family and friends.</p>
<h2>FOSDEM 2016</h2>
<p>During January, some of our OFBiz community members attended <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/">FOSDEM</a>, an open source conference for developers. It was held in Brussels and OFBiz community members from France, The Netherlands, Czech Republic and Belgium came along for conference as well as an informal meetup. The project was allocated a timeslot on the ASF booth to promote OFBiz.</p>
<p>With reportedly over 7000 attendees, there were lots of presentations, tutorials and devrooms to choose from. The ASF is planning to have a regular presence at FOSDEM in the future, so it is hoped that we can repeat the meetup and project promotion next year.</p>
<p>Please see below for the list of January changes for the OFBiz project.</p>
<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
