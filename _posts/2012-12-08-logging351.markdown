I'm pleased to announce that Apache log4php project has finished it's move from Subversion to Git version control system.

Links to the available repositories are as follows:

The official repository (and web interface), writable for developers:
<a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/logging-log4php.git">https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/logging-log4php.git</a>

Official read-only mirror:
<a href="git://git.apache.org/logging-log4php.git">git://git.apache.org/logging-log4php.git</a>

Github read-only mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4php">https://github.com/apache/logging-log4php</a>

The exact workflow is still under discussion, however it will probably be based heavily on the <a target="_blank" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a>.

We believe this will allow us to function better as an open source project, and accept user contributions more easily.
