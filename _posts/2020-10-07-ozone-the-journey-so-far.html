<p class="c9"><span class="c1 c16">Apache Hadoop Ozone is a highly scalable, redundant, distributed object-store. Ozone is designed to </span><span class="c1 c16">work well with the</span><span class="c6 c1">&nbsp;existing Apache Hadoop ecosystem applications like Hive, Spark etc. Moreover, it is designed for ease of operational use and scales to thousands of nodes and billions of objects in a single cluster. Ozone supports a Hadoop Compatible File System interface as well as the S3 protocol.</span></p>
<h1 class="c17" id="h.3n4ffhs0830b"><span class="c1 c32">Inception</span></h1>
<p class="c9"><span class="c1 c16">The Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) has been the de facto file system for big data and works most optimally when most of the files are large &ndash; tens to hundreds of MBs. HDFS suffers from the famous </span><span class="c1 c16 c33">small files limitation </span><span class="c6 c1">and struggles when the file count goes beyond 300 million. Ozone was designed to address HDFS&rsquo;s limitations and at the same time to work seamlessly with the existing Hadoop applications.</span></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c1 c16">Ozone releases are named after </span><span class="c1 c16 c27"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1602022926008000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ntHTbS17zFKGETl_OyR3g">US national parks</a></span><span class="c1 c16">. With every minor release, we move to the next letter for the release name and choose a new national park starting with that letter.</span></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c1 c16">Th</span><span class="c1 c16">is is the first release </span><span class="c1 c16">of Ozone and it came out on </span><span class="c8 c1">Oct 1, 2018. The release had basic Ozone functionalities working where users could create </span><span class="c4 c1">ozone volumes, buckets, and keys via Ozone shell interface. Similarly, Ozone Filesystem interface was also functional thereby ensuring YARN, Hive, Spark and MapReduce applications can work against Ozone FS seamlessly. It had support for REST and RPC protocols as well as Java client libraries were also shipped for Ozone supporting both RPC and REST. Data pipeline handling and recovery in case of node failures support were built into the system as well.</span></p>

<p class="c9 c31 c14"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c8 c1 c24">The next release came out on Nov 22, 2018. This release came out with support for a new S3 compatible REST server which ensured Ozone can be used from any S3 compatible tools like </span><span class="c8 c1 c29">AWS CLI and AWS Java SDK. For example, with this release now a user could create buckets using AWS CLI or use </span><span class="c0"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/goofys/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1602022926010000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wXQDSR8xx8TbuiqHH58-b">Goofys</a></span><span class="c8 c1 c24">&nbsp;which is an S3 FUSE driver to mount any Ozone bucket as a POSIX file system. </span><span class="c23 c8 c1">It also had support for a minimally complete S3 API set which includes GET, HEAD, DELETE operations on buckets as well as objects.</span></p>
<p class="c9 c14"><span class="c8 c1 c23"></span></p>

Kerberos-based authentication support for Ozone was added. It had support for Hadoop Delegation Tokens and Block Tokens, the motivation for which is to prevent the unauthorized access while keeping the protocol lightweight and without sharing the secret over the wire. Similar to this, S3Tokens were also added which are supposed to be used for every S3 client request.</span></p>
<p class="c9 c14"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c8 c1">Certificate Infrastructure for Ozone was plugged in to be used for </span><span class="c8 c1">certificate-based authentication for Ozone service components. </span><span class="c8 c1">Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) support came in as a part of this release as well which allows data blocks to be encrypted-at-rest along with </span><span class="c1 c4">Apache Ranger support to control Authorization.
