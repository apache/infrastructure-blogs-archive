<p>Apache Ignite community welcomes you to attend <a href="http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp/event-79.html" target="_blank">Big Data Bootcamp</a> on March 27th, 28th and 29th 2017 in Santa Clara, USA.</p>
<p>The conference gathers experts and vendors from Big Data realm in sunny California who will be covering a variety of Big Data products and technologies, including, but not limited to, Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning. </p>
<p>Apache Ignite will be introduced at the conference by its PMC chair and committer - Denis Magda.</p>
<p>As all we know, in-memory data grids bring exceptional performance and scalability gains to applications built on top of them. The applications truly achieve 10x more performance improvement and become easily scalable and fault-tolerant thanks to the unique data grids architecture. However, because of this particular architecture, a majority of data grids have to sacrifice traditional SQL support requiring application developers to completely rewrite their SQL-based code to support data grid specific APIs. This, however, is not true for Apache Ignite.</p>
<p>In this presentation, Denis will introduce Apache Ignite SQL Grid component that combines the best of two worlds - performance and scalability of data grids and traditional ANSI-99 SQL support of relational databases. Moreover, Denis will take an existing application that works with a relational database and will show how to run it on top of Apache Ignite with minimum efforts.</p>
<p>The talk is called <b><a href="http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp-79/speaker-details/denis-magda-41504.html" target="_blank">"Apache Ignite SQL Grid: Hot Blend of Traditional SQL and Swift Data Grid"</a></b> and takes place at 1:00 PM - 1:40PM on March 28. Refer to <a href="http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp/schedule-79.html" target="_blank">Big Data Bootcamp's agenda</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Finally, use promotional code <font color="red">SPEAKER</font> to receive $200 discount on or before  March 15th by registering at <a href="http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp/attendee-registration-79.html" target="_blank">the conference site.</a></p>
<p>See you at the conference!</p>
