<div><strong><em>by Rich Bowen</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Within The Apache Software Foundation, many of us have different roles. I am a committer on the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd project</a>, and also a <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/governance/pmcs.html">PMC member</a> on that project. I am the <a href="http://apachecon.com/">Vice President, Conferences</a>. I am a board member. And I&rsquo;m a member of the Foundation. I'm also an employee of Red Hat, and may, at times, be perceived to be speaking for my employer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am a father, husband, brother, son, employee, and so on. How I interact with my daughter is very different from how I interact with my manager. I use different language, wield different authority, and expect different results.</div>
<div></div>

<div>Ten years ago at ApacheCon in Oakland, Bertrand Delacretaz gave a talk about hats. We all laughed a lot. But he was making a serious point. At the Apache Software Foundation &ndash;indeed, in life&ndash; we all wear many different hats.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, whereas it's pretty clear, in real life, whether I&rsquo;m addressing my daughter or my manager, on Apache mailing lists it's seldom, if ever, clear which hat I'm wearing in any given situation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I like to operate on the following principle when communicating in the Apache community: Wear the smallest hat possible for the situation, but assume that everyone is seeing the biggest hat possible.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, what does that mean?</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the list above of my Apache hats (Committer, PMC Member, Foundation Member, V.P. Conferences, Director), there are various levels of authority. As a project committer, I can make code changes, but as a PMC member, I can reject other people&rsquo;s changes. As a Foundation Member, I can express an opinion, but as a Director, I can state the official position of the Foundation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The difficulty comes when, on a mailing list, I say something, intending it to be my personal opinion (i.e., Foundation Member hat) and someone reads it as the official position of the Foundation (i.e., Foundation Director hat).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thus, in any given situation, I have an obligation to wield the smallest stick I possibly can, appropriate to the situation. Also, to clearly communicate how I am speaking, if there&rsquo;s any chance of confusion, by saying things like "speaking as a member, and expressing my private opinion &hellip;", or "It is the opinion of the Board of Directors that &hellip;"&nbsp; And, since there&rsquo;s always a chance of confusion, due to many factors, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to make this clarification almost every time, if you&rsquo;re in a position where you do, in fact, wear multiple hats.</div>
<div></div>
<div>By wearing the smallest hat possible&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&ndash;</span>i.e., speaking with the voice with the least authority<span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&ndash;</span>&nbsp;you allow other people to be free to express their own dissenting opinions without feeling that they have already been overruled. This is in line with our culture of providing a level playing field, where all voices are equal, and all opinions are weighed the same.</div>
