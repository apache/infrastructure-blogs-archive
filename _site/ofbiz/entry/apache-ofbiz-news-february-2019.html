<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have more news about OFBiz build support with Java Open JDK &amp; Java 11 and, we welcome a new committer along with our usual list of features and improvements.</p>
<h2>New Committer</h2>
<p>During February the Project Management Committee (PMC) invited Mathieu Lirzin as a new committer. Please join us in welcoming and congratulating Mathieu in his new role on the project, and also thanking him for all his contributions.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="https://markmail.org/message/wg6yqt5tmeujvy5l">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jacopo Cappellato for the efforts, Jacques &amp; Taher for your valuable inputs and everyone who contributed to this effort&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support with Java Open JDK and Java 11</h2>
<p>Considering that now Oracle JDKs are no more free for commercial use, the community discussed &amp; decided to provide OFBiz support with <g class="gr_ gr_65 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="65" data-gr-id="65">openJDK</g> Java build. It was also decided to keep release 17.12 (unreleased) on Java 8, and 18.12 (unreleased) &amp; trunk be switched to Java 11 on OpenJDK</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757">OFBIZ-10757</a>, <a href="https://markmail.org/message/argcnb5ve4wvkik2">Mail thread,</a> and <a href="https://markmail.org/message/argcnb5ve4wvkik2">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jacopo, Jacques, Michael, Taher, Deepak and to everyone who gave their valuable inputs.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Close pending works from Christian Carlow</h2>
<p>The community admires the efforts of Christian Carlow. Since he has been inactive for a very long time with no progress on the work by him, the community has decided to close tickets with obsolete patches as 'won't do'.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://markmail.org/message/su5t5ebgcbwy27yc">Mail thread</a>.</p>
