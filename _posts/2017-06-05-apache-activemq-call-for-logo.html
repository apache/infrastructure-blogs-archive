<p><a href="http://activemq.apache.org/images/activemq-logo.png">The Apache ActiveMQ logo</a> was created a few years ago. While the project continues to evolve, the logo needs to be updated to reflect current ActiveMQ technology. So, the PMC has discussed making a &ldquo;Call For Entry&rdquo; where you can submit a new ActiveMQ Logo.</p>
<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Make your Apache ActiveMQ logo submissions as a PR with your files towards in this folder:<br />
      <a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img">https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img</a></p>
<p>Current submissions will be seen as <a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/pulls">Pull Requests</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a contest where you could win the possibility of saying: &ldquo;I made that cool logo&rdquo; :) Also you would get a big thanks from the Apache community.</p>
<p>Apache ActiveMQ is a fast and scalable Apache 2.0 licensed message broker. It&rsquo;s built around standardized messaging protocols like AMQP 1.0 and MQTT, and standard APIs such as JMS. It&rsquo;s an ideal fit for the messaging needs of a wide range of projects, from enterprise applications and integration solutions (in combination with Apache Camel) to Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Regardless of having your entry being selected or not, open source is a community experience, where your submission will be part of a bigger discussion. We are really looking forward to this experience and to know your art.</p></p>
<p>The new Logo submission should have two versions:</p>
<li>An Abstract image, representing ActiveMQ as a Messaging System (preferably square).</li>
<li>A Combined word ActiveMQ with the abstract image you created, like a banner style logo.</li>
<p>Also, it would be nice to have:</p>
<li> .png files to visualize the art you made.</li>
<li>Vector based files (.svg) so anyone would be able to work with the sources of the file and have the image looking nice on any scale.</li>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Make your submissions as a Pull Request with your files towards this folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img">https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img</a></p>
<p>If you are not familiar with git and github you can still attach your submission towards  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6689">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6689</a></p></p>
<p>The entry will be open for 30 days, until July 1st 2017, before we start a vote which will be open for 1 week.</p>
