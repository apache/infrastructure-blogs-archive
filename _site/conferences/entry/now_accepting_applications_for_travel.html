<meta name="description" content="The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)&#39;s Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) is&nbsp;now accepting applications for ApacheCon North America 2011, 7-11 November&nbsp;in Vancouver BC, Canada&nbsp;http://apachecon.com/. The TAC is seeking individuals from the Apache community at-large --users,&nbsp;developers, educators, students, Committers, and Members-- who would like to&nbsp;attend ApacheCon, but need some financial support in order to be able to get&nbsp;there. There are limited places available, and all applicants will be scored&nbsp;on their individual merit. Financial assistance is available to cover flights/trains, accommodation and&nbsp;entrance fees either in part or in full, depending on circumstances.&nbsp;However, the support available for those attending only the BarCamp (7-8&nbsp;November) is less than that for those attending the entire event (Conference&nbsp;+ BarCamp 7-11 November). The Travel Assistance Committee aims to support&nbsp;all official ASF events, including cross-project activities; as such, it may&nbsp;be prudent for those in Asia and Europe to wait for an event geographically&nbsp;closer to them.&nbsp; More information can be found at http://www.apache.org/travel/index.html including a link to the online application and detailed instructions for&nbsp;submitting. Applications will close on 8 July 2011 at 22:00 BST (UTC/GMT +1). The TAC team wish good luck to all those who will apply, and thank everyone in advance for&nbsp;tweeting, blogging, and otherwise spreading the word. # # #&nbsp;" />
