<p>We are excited to announce the release of <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/downloads.html">Apache TomEE 1.5</a>.  The volume of<br />
            feedback on the 1.0.0 Final drove such an impressive number of fixes and features into TomEE that the release number<br />
            has been updated to reflect <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/tomee-1.5.0-release-notes.html">the changes</a>.</p>
<p>The team is proud to announce certification of a new Apache TomEE stack that includes the Web Profile plus JAX-RS for<br />
            RESTful Web Services. The new 'TomEE JAXRS' distribution shows TomEE's commitment to progressing its certification<br />
            efforts beyond the Web Profile and is a great alternative to the TomEE Plus distribution.  See the<br />
            <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/comparison.html">comparison</a> for a view of all Apache TomEE distributions.</p>
<p>Another great feature is the extended support for database connection pools.  In addition to the previously<br />
            supported Apache Commons-DBCP, the 1.5 release adds transaction support to the native Apache Tomcat and BoneCP<br />
            connection pools.  The two additional pools offer great alternatives to applications under heavy load.  JMX<br />
            instrumentation and statistics have also been added generically to all pools and provide a great level of<br />
            monitoring and management.</p>
<p>Other major features include deploy-time enhancement for JPA Entities via Apache OpenJPA, support including JPA providers in webapps,<br />
            ability to mock and inject mocks in unit tests and a powerful new <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/tomee-maven-plugin.html">TomEE Maven Plugin</a> which can<br />
            provision servers, install libraries, deploy webapps and more.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone who gave feedback and contibuted to improve Apache TomEE on a daily basis!</p>
