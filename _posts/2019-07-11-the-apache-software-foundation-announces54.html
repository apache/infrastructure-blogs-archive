<div></div>
<div><strong>Wakefield, MA</strong> &mdash;11 July 2019&mdash; The Apache&reg; Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the event program for the European edition of ApacheCon&trade;, the ASF's official global conference series. ApacheCon Europe will take place 22-24 October 2019 at the Kulturbrauerei in Berlin, Germany.</div>
<div></div>
<div>ApacheCon draws attendees from more than 60 countries to experience "Tomorrow's Technology Today" by showcasing key Open Source technologies independent of business interests, corporate biases, or sales pitches.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>ApacheCon content is selected entirely by Apache projects and their communities, enabling participants at all levels to learn about the latest innovations in dozens of categories. The ApacheCon Europe program categories include Big Data, Community, IoT, Machine Learning, and Open Source Design, among others. Participants learn about Open Source development "The Apache Way", through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, hackathons, and more in a deliberately intimate, collaborative, vendor-neutral environment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Dozens of Apache projects will be represented across dedicated categories and project tracks, including Airflow, Beam, Calcite, Cassandra, Flink, Hivemall (incubating), HTTP Server, Ignite, IoTDB (incubating), Kafka, MXNet, Mynewt, NiFi, Spark, Tika, Tomcat, Training (incubating), and more. The full program is available at <a href="https://aceu19.apachecon.com/schedule">https://aceu19.apachecon.com/schedule</a> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></div>
