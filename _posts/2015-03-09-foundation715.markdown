    <p><b><i>Mature, robust, Open Source relational Big Data warehousing solution provides advanced &quot;SQL-on-Hadoop®&quot; functionality and support.</i></b></p> 
    <p><b><i></i>Forest Hill, MD —9 March 2015—</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache™ Tajo™ v0.10.0, the latest version of the advanced Open Source data warehousing system in Apache Hadoop®.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>Apache Tajo is used for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online aggregation, and ETL (extract-transform-load process) on large data sets stored on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and other data sources. By supporting SQL standards and leveraging advanced database techniques, Tajo allows direct control of distributed execution and data flow across a variety of query evaluation strategies and optimization opportunities.</p> 
    <p>&quot;Tajo has evolved over the last couple of years into a mature 'SQL-on-Hadoop' engine,&quot; said Hyunsik Choi, Vice President of Apache Tajo. &quot;The improved JDBC driver in this release allows users to easily access Tajo as if users use traditional RDBMSs. We have verified new JDBC driver on many commercial BI solutions and various SQL tools. It was easy and works successfully.&quot;</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>Tajo v0.10.0 reflects dozens of new features and improvements, including:</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p> </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Oracle and PostgreSQL catalog store support</li> 
      <li>Direct JSON file support</li> 
      <li>HBase storage integration (allowing users to directly access HBase tables through Tajo)</li> 
      <li>Improved JDBC driver for easier use of JDBC application</li> 
      <li>Improved Amazon S3 support</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> </p> 
  </div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>A complete overview of all new enhancements can be found in the project release notes at <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/tajo/tajo-0.10.0-rc1/relnotes.html">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/tajo/tajo-0.10.0-rc1/relnotes.html</a></div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <div> 
    <p>Described as &quot;a dark horse in the race for mass adoption&quot; by GigaOM, Tajo is in use at numerous organizations worldwide, including Gruter, Korea University, Melon, NASA JPL Radio Astronomy and Airborne Snow Observatory projects, and SK Telecom for processing Web-scale data sets in real time.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div>Byeong Hwa Yun, Project Leader at Melon, said &quot;Congratulations on 0.10.0 release! Melon is the biggest music streaming service company in S. Korea. We use Tajo as an ETL tool as well as an analytical processing system. We have experienced that Tajo makes our ETL jobs faster 1.5x-10x than Hive does. Besides, HBase storage integration in this release enables our analytic pipeline simpler. We hope that Tajo has a large role to play in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.&quot;&nbsp;</div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <div> 
    <p>&quot;I'm very happy with that Tajo has rapidly developed in recent years,&quot; said Jihoon Son, member of the Apache Tajo Project Management Committee. &quot;One of the most impressive parts is the improved support on Amazon S3. Thanks to the EMR bootstrap, users can exploit Tajo's advanced SQL functionalities on AWS with just a few clicks.&quot;</p>
