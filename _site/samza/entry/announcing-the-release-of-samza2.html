<meta name="description" content="We are thrilled to announce the release of Apache Samza 1.3.0 Today Samza forms the backbone of hundreds of real-time production applications across a multitude of companies, such as LinkedIn, VMWare, Slack, Redfin among many others. This release of Samza adds a variety of features and capabilities to Samza&rsquo;s existing arsenal, coupled with improved documentation, code snippets, examples. Samza provides leading support for large-scale stateful stream processing with: First class support for local state (with RocksDB store). This allows a stateful application to scale up to 1.1 Million events/sec on a single machine with SSD. Support for incremental checkpointing of state instead of full snapshots. This enables Samza to scale to applications with very large state. A fully asynchronous programming model that makes parallelizing remote calls efficient and effortless. High level API for expressing complex stream processing pipelines in a few lines of code. Beam Samza Runner that marries Beam&rsquo;s best in class support for EventTime based windowed processing and sophisticated triggering with Samza&rsquo;s stable and scalable stateful processing model. A fully pluggable model for input sources (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB streams etc.) and output systems (HDFS, Kafka, ElastiCache etc.). A Table API that provides a common abstraction for accessing remote or local databases and allowing developers are able to &quot;join&quot; an input event stream with such a Table. Flexible deployment model for running the the applications in any hosting environment and with cluster managers other than YARN.

New Features, Upgrades and Bug Fixes This release brings the following features, upgrades, and capabilities (highlights): Startpoint support improvement Samza SQL improvement Table API improvement Miscellaneous bug fixes Full list of the jiras addressed in this release can be found here.
