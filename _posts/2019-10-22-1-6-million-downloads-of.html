<p>On Sep, 21st we have released Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7. Since then we had <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/4.1.7/stats/timeline?dates=2019-09-21+to+2019-10-21" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffice download statistics">1.6 million</a><br />
 download requests. And this is only for the newest release. There are<br />
more for other versions that the users download due to their special<br />
needs. And not included are the many others from news magazins - online<br />
or on CD/DVD.</p>
<p>Another impressive number is: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/timeline?dates=2012-01-01+to+2019-10-21" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffce download statistics">294 million</a>. These are the downloads over all versions since 01st January, 2012.</p>
<p>Also with this post we want to call your attention again to 2 important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We strongly advise to download software only from its original<br />
source. Then you are on the safe side to avoid any viruses or malware.<br />
For Apache OpenOffice it is "<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffice Official Download">https://www.openoffice.org/download/</a>".</p>
</li>
<li>You don't need a permission or even registration to use or copy<br />
Apache OpenOffice as it is free and open source software. So, no problem<br />
 with license keys and fees and other restricting stuff that is wasting<br />
your lifetime.</li>
</ol>
