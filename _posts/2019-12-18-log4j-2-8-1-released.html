<p>
The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.8.1 release!</p>
<p>Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.</p>
<p>This release primarily contains bugfixes and minor enhancements. More details on the new features and fixes are itemized below.</p>
<p>Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the addition of new methods to the Logger interface. If you have code that does:</p>
<p><tt>logger.error(null, &ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>
or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous. To correct this either do:</p>
<p><tt>logger.error(&ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>
or</p>
<p><tt>logger.error((Marker) null, &ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>
The Log4j 2.8.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.</p>

<p>
Apache Log4j 2.8.1 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.</p>
<p>Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
