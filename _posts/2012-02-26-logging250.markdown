After 2 years of experimental development the Apache Logging project has moved the log4j 2.0 code to the main trunk of log4j. You can find the code at
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/log4j2/trunk">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/log4j2/trunk</a>.

Log4j 2.0 supports Java 5.0 and has many interesting features including: <ul><li>Support for using the SLF4J or Commons Logging APIs</li><li>Configuration via JSON (as well as XML)</li><li>Automatic reloading of configurations without losing logging events</li><li>Plugin architecture that allows new components to easily be added</li><li>Allows variables from System Properties, MDC, Log event data, and more to be accessed in the configuration</li></ul>

Your help would be greatly appreciated! Please provide feedback, suggestions and questions to log4j-dev@logging.apache.org.

Patches, enhancement requests and  bugs can be reported to: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2</a>

A website is prepared but has not been deployed to logging.apache.org yet. Ralph Goers, who initiated the work on Log4j2, has uploaded a preview at
<a href="https://people.apache.org/~rgoers/log4j2/">https://people.apache.org/~rgoers/log4j2/</a>

Best regards,
Your Logging team
