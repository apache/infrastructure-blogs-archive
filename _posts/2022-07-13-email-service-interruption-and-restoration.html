<p><b>July 13, 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(23, 43, 77); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;">At around 09:11 UTC on Tuesday, July 12th 2022, the primary mailing list server (colloquially known as <b>Hermes</b>) at The Apache Software Foundation suffered a fatal breakdown and became unresponsive.</span><br></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(23, 43, 77); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;">The Infrastructure team (Infra) was immediately notified and, in cooperation with our data center provider, attempted to restore services and notify the Foundation of the outage.</p>

We had announced the start of this migration on June 15, 2022.</p>

The team continued to address and monitor issues arising as a result of the migration, and the mailing list services were deemed fully operational at approximately 20:00 UTC.</p>
