<div><strong><em>Charitable donation helps underwrite the world's largest Open Source foundation, benefiting billions of users who depend on Apache's freely-available Open Source community-driven software.</em></strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;18 January 2018&mdash;</strong> The Apache&reg; Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that it has received a 88.34 Bitcoin (BTC) donation from the Pineapple Fund, valued at $1M at the time of the donation.</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency is a fascinating way to support the ASF," said Kevin A. McGrail, ASF Vice President of Fundraising. "We look forward to using Pineapple Fund's donation to enhance our mission to provide Open Source software that is intrinsic to computing, from Web servers to smartphones to Cloud computing to the next evolutionary technology."&nbsp;</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The Pineapple Fund is a project donating 5500 BTC (~$86M) to various charities around the world, with the goal of making "bold and smart bets that will impact everyone in our world". <a href="https://pineapplefund.org/">https://pineapplefund.org/</a></p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In addition to the Pineapple Fund's charitable donation, the ASF receives financial support from corporate sponsors and individual donors. These essential funds help the ASF ensure that Apache software projects continue to be available to users around the world at absolutely no cost.</p>
<p>As a United States private, 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF is funded through tax-deductible contributions from corporations, foundations, and private individuals. Their collective contributions offset day-to-day operating expenses such as bandwidth and connectivity, servers and hardware, legal and accounting services, brand management and public relations, general office expenditures, and support staff. Approximately 75% of the ASF's annual budget is dedicated to running critical infrastructure support services that keep Apache services running 24x7x365 at near 100% uptime.</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>There are two ways to help the ASF reach its financial goals:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Individual Donations --for one-off or recurring gifts of any size, via credit card, PayPal, ACH, and more;
</li>
<li>ASF Sponsorship program --for organizations, individuals, foundations, and endowments contributing $6,000 or more.</li>
</ol>
