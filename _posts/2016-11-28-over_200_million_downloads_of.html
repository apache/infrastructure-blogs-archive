<p>Apache OpenOffice<br />
continues to enjoy the user's valuation.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Recently the new record<br />
mark of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/downloads.html" target="_blank" title="More than 200 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice">200 million downloads</a> was reached. The<br />
downloads are managed by our partner <a href="https://www.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="SourceForge">SourceForge</a> .</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The high demand of the<br />
most current release 4.1.3 - that was released in October - is an<br />
acknowledgment of the previous work and a great motivation for the<br />
future.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The ongoing trust of our<br />
users is also a thankful expression to all people who put their personal<br />
spare time and effort into the project and software.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But of course there are<br />
more ways to distribute Apache OpenOffice. The most common one is to<br />
download the binary packages from one of the many mirror servers. But<br />
also printed magazines with an included DVD are possible, you can get<br />
it from your neighbors, friends, coworkers, it's part of free<br />
software collections, and many more ways we can think of.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You don't need a<br />
permission or even registration to use or copy Apache OpenOffice as<br />
it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" title="Free and Open Source Software">free and open source software</a>.<br />
However, this makes it also difficult to get meaningful numbers of<br />
actual users. It's not measurable if a download stands for a single<br />
user or an installation in a larger network.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Furthermore it's not known<br />
if Apache OpenOffice was downloaded the first time or it's an update<br />
for a previous installed version. Much more interesting to know is<br />
that the statistics show a steady download of 100,000 every day.</p>
<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It's safe to say that<br />
Apache OpenOffice has one of the highest user base in the world of<br />
free software projects. And for this we want to say <b>Thank You!</b></p>
