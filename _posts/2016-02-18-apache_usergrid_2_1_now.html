<p>The Apache Usergrid community is happy to announce that Usergrid 2.1 is now available for download.</p>
<p>Apache Usergrid 2.1 is a major revision of the Usergrid code-base that includes a new, improved and streamlined persistence and query engine, as well as support for iOS and Android Push Notifications. Usergrid 2.1 supports the very same REST API as the Usergrid 1.x releases, but this new release is incompatible with the Usergrid 1.x database format.</p>
<p>The new "core persistence" engine in Usegrid 2.1 has been under development for two years now. Internally, this new engine provides a set of new modules for Entity Collections, Graph Database, Maps, Query-Index, Queues and Caching. The core persistence design favors simple and composable operations that can be made asynchronous via RxJava, uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to avoid use of locks and the Query-Index module relies on ElasticSearch.  Version 2.1 is the first official release to include the new core persistence engine, but members of the Usergrid team have been using Usergrid 2.x in production environments for about a year now.</p></p>
<p> If you're looking to deploy Usergrid, then 2.1 is where you should start. As we say on the download page, it's the best available version.</p>
