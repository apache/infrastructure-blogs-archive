As promised in my&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/protecting-apache-ignite-from-meltdown">initial blog post</a> on this matter, Apache Ignite community&nbsp;applied security patches against the notorious Meltdown Spectre vulnerabilities and completed performance testing of general operations and workloads that are typical for Ignite deployments.</p>
<p>
The security patches were applied only for&nbsp;<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754" target="_blank">CVE-2017-5754</a>&nbsp;(Meltdown) and&nbsp;<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753" target="_blank">CVE-2017-5753</a>&nbsp;(Spectre Variant 1) vulnerabilities. The patches for&nbsp;<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715" target="_blank">CVE-2017-5715</a>&nbsp;(Spectre Variant 2) for the hardware the community used for testing are not stable yet an can <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/" target="_blank">cause system reboot issues or another unpredictable behavior</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The applied patches have shown that the performance implications&nbsp;are negligible - the performance drop is just in the 0 - 7% range as the figure shows:</p>
<p><img alt="Spectre_and_Meltdown_Benchmarks" src="https://www.gridgain.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/meltdown-benchmarks.png" width="800" height="2040"/></p>
<p>
Thus, Apache Ignite community highly recommends its customers and partners to consider&nbsp;security patches for&nbsp;CVE-2017-5754&nbsp;(Meltdown) and&nbsp;CVE-2017-5753&nbsp;(Spectre Variant 1) in their deployment environments and contact us on the user list if you run into a larger performance drop in your use case.</p>
<p>
At the same time, we're keeping an eye on Intel announcements and will validate the performance implications of Spectre Variant 2 once a solution is released by the hardware vendor.</p>
<p>
Just for your reference, the benchmarks were executed in the following environment and configuration.</p>
