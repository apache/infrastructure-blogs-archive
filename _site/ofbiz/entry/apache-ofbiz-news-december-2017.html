<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News December 2017 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about our usual end of year tasks to create a new branch but this time it&#39;s two instead of one!. New Framework and Plugin 17.12 Branches If you have been following our list of monthly fixes and improvements then you may have noticed the separation being made between &quot;Framework&quot; and &quot;Plugins&quot;. As part of our usual end of year tasks, the community looks at creating a new branch that will become the basis for the next release. During December the community decided to create not one, but two new branches. This is the first time we have created two in parallel, one for the framework and one for the plugins. Both branches were created with 17.12 as part of their descriptions. The framework branch contains not only the framework components but also the core applications such as Accounting, Human Resources, Manufacturing, Marketing, Order Management while the plugins includes the other applications such as eCommerce, Asset Maintenance, Project Manager and Scrum. Note that these two branches are not yet released and will be stablised over the next few months until they are ready. Thanks very much to the many members of the community who have done a lot of amazing work out with code cleanup and refactoring. The overall aim is to make OFBiz flexible yet simple to implement. Users can still install OFBiz with both core and plugin applications together but also have the flexibility of having a framework only version. In future, we hope that our contributors will also start to create their own plugins that can be made available to the community. New features and improvements Functional enhancements and improvements as well as updates of third party libraries and source code refactoring: Framework Move the hhfacility application and jQuery mobile to Attic (OFBIZ-10032) Replace Rainbow OFBiz logo (OFBIZ-10034) Move all data in applications to the datamodel component and remove unused files (OFBIZ-9501) Move selected seed data for product, accounting, manufacturing, humanres, marketing, commonext and order component.

Apache Tomcat (OFBIZ-10026) Upgrade Jquery 1.11.0 to JQuery 3.2.1 (OFBIZ-9978) Include css files to theme properties and screens. Manually add datepicker-en.js and datepicker-it-CH.js. Update JGrowl from 1.4.1 to 1.4.6 Fix defects reported by FindBugs for ca. 50 packages in all components (OFBIZ-9450) Create a new entity FacilityCalendar (OFBIZ-10040) This entity creates the one-to-many relationship between facility and calendar. Handle service response effectively in ServiceUtil and Accounting (OFBIZ-9981 and OFBIZ-10021) General refactoring and code improvements in ca. 80 packages in all components (OFBIZ-9836) Changes include:&lt;/p&gt; Remove unnecessary parameters in diamond operators Remove unnecessary else-phrase Use multi catches Enhance for-loops Remove exceptions which aren&#39;t thrown Remove old commented out code Use braces around all if and else statements Replace all delegator findByAnd and findOne method callings by EntityQuery methods (OFBIZ-10029) Always check if debug verbose is on when using Debug.logVerbose() (OFBIZ-10052) Website can manage hidden webapp (OFBIZ-10088) Improve RequestHandler.makeLink code to manage url generation with added webapp path.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News December 2017</h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about our usual end of year tasks to create a new branch but this time it's two instead of one!.<br />
<!--more--> </p>
<h2>New Framework and Plugin 17.12 Branches</h2>
<p>If you have been following our list of monthly fixes and improvements then you may have noticed the separation being made between "Framework" and "Plugins". As part of our usual end of year tasks, the community looks at creating a new branch that will become the basis for the next release. During December the community decided to create not one, but two new branches. This is the first time we have created two in parallel, one for the framework and one for the plugins.</p>
<p>Both branches were created with 17.12 as part of their descriptions. The framework branch contains not only the framework components but also the core applications such as Accounting, Human Resources, Manufacturing, Marketing, Order Management while the plugins includes the other applications such as eCommerce, Asset Maintenance, Project Manager and Scrum.</p>
<p><strong>Note that these two branches are not yet released and will be stablised over the next few months until they are ready.</strong> </p>
<p>Thanks very much to the many members of the community who have done a lot of amazing work out with code cleanup and refactoring. The overall aim is to make OFBiz flexible yet simple to implement. Users can still install OFBiz with both core and plugin applications together but also have the flexibility of having a framework only version. In future, we hope that our contributors will also start to create their own plugins that can be made available to the community.</p>
