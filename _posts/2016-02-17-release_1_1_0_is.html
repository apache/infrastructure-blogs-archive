<p>On behalf of the Apache Bigtop team, I'd love to announce the general availability of the Bigtop 1.1.0 release.</p>
<p>A few highlights of this release include: </p>
<ul>
<li>five different operating systems are supported</li>
<li>a brand new ppc64le architecture was added to the support matrix</li>
<li>most stable Hadoop 2.7.1 is used</li>
<li>new data notebooks project Zeppelin (incubating)</li>
<li>addition of Apache Hama</li>
<li>toolchain is updated to the latest versions of the development tools</li>
<li>standard docker containers are available for builds, testing, and alike</li>
<li>on-going improvements in the unattended cluster deployment and testing</li>
<li>improvements in the smoke-tests coverage and UX</li>
<li>and many upgrades to the latest versions of the ecosystem projects<br />(Crunch, Flume, Ignite, Hive, Mahout, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Spark, and many others)</li>
</ul>
<p>With Bigtop 1.1 the community continues on the path of delivering the most advanced, openly-developer data analytics stack to date. This is a true bigtop project, bringing together virtually all of the Apache Software Foundation data processing projects.<br />This release of the Apache Bigdata platform include close to 260 bug fixes and new features.</p>
<p>Deploying Bigtop is easy: grab the repo/list file for your favorite Linux distribution:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/bigtop-1.1.0/repos/<br />and you'll be running your very own bigdata cluster in no time!<br />Alternatively, you can use Bigtop provisioner to spin-up a virtual cluster with a single command as explained in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Bigtop+Provisioner+User+Guide</p>
<p>I want to emphasize the great work done by the project contributors, and thank everyone in this and other communities who made this release possible!</p>
