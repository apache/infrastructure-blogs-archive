This is our third community update – there’s a lot going on, so let's get started.

Apache Ignite experts have already spoken at two meetups this month, both in Silicon Valley, but there are several more scheduled this month around the world.

<p style="margin-bottom:15.0pt"><span style="line-height:19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><span style="color:#333333">But Denis isn’t having all the fun – next Monday <i>(Sept. 18)</i>, technology evangelist Akmal Chaudhri will speak at the Cambridge .NET User Group.
