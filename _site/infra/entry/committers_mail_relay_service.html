These methodologies check that incoming email actually originated via a valid mail server for the senders domain.&nbsp; For example if you send from myuserid@apache.org, but you just send that via your ISP at home, it could be construed as being junk as it never came via an apache.org mail server. &nbsp;Some time ago we setup a service on people.apache.org to cater for this, but it was never enforced and it seems that the SMTP daemon running the service is not 100% RFC compliant and thus some people have been unable to use this service. As of today, we have stood up a new service on host mail-relay.apache.org that will allow committers to send their apache.org emails via a daemon that is RFC compliant and uses your LDAP credentials.
