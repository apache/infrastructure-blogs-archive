Composite Oriented Programming allows developers to work with &#39;fragments&#39;, smaller than classes, and &#39;compose&#39; fragments into larger &#39;composites&#39; which acts like the regular objects. Apache Zest also tackles the enforcement of application composition, i.e. composites are declared in modules, modules are contained in layers and access between how layers are controlled/enforced. &quot;Apache Zest is a completely new way of writing software&quot;, said Niclas Hedhman, Vice President of Apache Zest. &quot;Object orientation isn&#39;t the appropriate abstraction, as objects in real application get too bloated and inter-dependent.

In early 2007, Hedhman convinced &Ouml;berg to start a new Open Source project around this concept, and Qi4j was born. Since the project&#39;s was first announced at the 2007 Oredev conference, 28 people have contributed source to the project, and many others have participated on mailing lists regarding direction, concepts and design. Apache Zest has the unique designation as the first project to enter the ASF as a pTLP &ndash;provisional Top-Level Project&ndash; without entering the Apache Incubator (the official entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation). As part of its eligibility, Apache Zest had to meet the rigorous requirements of the Apache Maturity Model http://s.apache.org/O4p , which addresses the integrity of a project&#39;s code, copyright, licenses, releases, consensus building, and independence, among other qualities. Apache Zest became an official ASF Top-Level Project in March 2015. &lt;/p&gt; &quot;Apache Zest arrived to the Apache Software Foundation four months ago, and we are incredibly satisfied with the progress on both the codebase as well as the transition from our previous Qi4j identity&quot;, added Hedhman.
