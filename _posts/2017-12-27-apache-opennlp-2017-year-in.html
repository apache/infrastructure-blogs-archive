  content: 'It is also important to understand the importance of the NLP API in an
    event-driven environment. That is, it is not the goal to write one specific script,
    but rather to use a variety of NLP commands as part of a larger, event-driven
    processing process. If I ran this script on every possible event, I could generate
    quite an impressive result. The above script will get its input from two sources:
    EventSource , which returns JSON objects from the database, and EventSourceOutput
    , which can output all events, separated by periods.'
