<meta name="description" content="Bolsters Big Data processing by providing extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as Apache Spark. Forest Hill, MD &ndash;29 June 2016&ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Bahir&trade; has become a Top-Level Project (TLP). Apache Bahir bolsters Big Data processing by serving as a home for existing connectors that initiated under Apache Spark, as well as provide additional extensions/plugins for other related distributed system, storage, and query execution systems. &quot;Apache Bahir is a new community that aims to be a place to curate extensions related to distributed analytic platforms following the Apache Governance,&quot; said Luciano Resende, Vice President of Apache Bahir and an Architect at IBM contributing to The Apache Software Foundation for over 10 years. &quot;The project is initially offering a few Apache Spark extensions but it is definitely open for expanding to other platforms such as Apache Beam, Apache Flink and others.&quot; Bahir code is extracted from the Apache Spark project, and has spun out as a standalone project to provide implementations for different Spark related extensions/plugins, connectors, and other pluggable components. Current extensions include: &nbsp;streaming-akka (akka:Open Source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the Java Virtual Machine) &nbsp;streaming-mqtt (mqtt: lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks) &nbsp;streaming-twitter (Twitter: online social networking service; Bahir allows the processing of social data from Twitter) &nbsp;streaming-zeromq (zeromq: a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications) In addition, Apache Bahir has a strong relationship with different storage layers; the project intends to extend that relationship to a number of other ASF projects and Apache-licensed initiatives. &quot;We are very interested in streaming-mqtt for remote sensing applications and control/monitoring. We have a lot of Big Data needs in Earth science especially in remote and difficult to access environments and plugins such as streaming-mqtt from Bahir provide a readily accessible and Apache-based solution to that,&quot; said Chris Mattmann, member of the Apache Bahir Project Management Committee, and Chief Architect, Instrument and Science Data Systems Section at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. &quot;We are very motivated to increase the size and diversity of the Apache Bahir community,&quot; added Resende. &quot;We welcome feedback, use cases, bug reports, patch submissions, code contributions, documentation, new extension proposals, and other ways to participate.&quot; Availability and Oversight Apache Bahir software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.
