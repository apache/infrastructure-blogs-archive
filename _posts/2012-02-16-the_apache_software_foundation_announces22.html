  content: I have a new T-Mobile smart phone When scrolling through settings, device
    etc. I came across "Open Source Licenses" When reading through this it shows "apache.org/license/version"
    2.0/Jan 2004.What is "Apache"? Can you please explain this to me? And it's reason
    why this is on my phone. Reading documention on your website I do not understand
    most information. Is this "Apache" on all "Smart Phones". Why does it show 2004?
    I appreciate your support

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="yiv1807539067MsoNormal"><font size="3"><b><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';">Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 15 February 2012 &ndash;</span></b><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),<span> </span>the<br />
 all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open<br />
Source projects and initiatives, today announced that Apache Deltacloud<br />
has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project<br />
(TLP), signifying that the Project&rsquo;s community and products have been<br />
well-governed under the ASF&rsquo;s meritocratic process and principles.</span></font></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="yiv1807539067MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3">Apache<br />
 Deltacloud defines a RESTful Web Service application programming<br />
interface (API) for interacting with Cloud service providers and<br />
resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In addition, it consists<br />
of a number of implementations of this API for the most popular Clouds<br />
such as Amazon, Eucalyptus, GoGrid, IBM, Microsoft, OpenStack,<br />
Rackspace, and more. In addition to the API server, the project also<br />
provides client libraries for a wide variety of languages.</font></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="yiv1807539067MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3">"We<br />
 are thrilled to have the project's growth and maturity recognized by<br />
The Apache Software Foundation," said David Lutterkort, Chair of the<br />
Apache Deltacloud Project Management Committee and Principal Software<br />
Engineer at Red Hat., "Deltacloud has shown the value of vendor-neutral<br />
cloud management API's, and we are excited that, as an Apache Top-Level<br />
Project, we will continue to provide choice to cloud users; graduation<br />
is a great milestone for our community."</font></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="yiv1807539067MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3">"Ubiquity<br />
 between clouds will be critical in the coming years and Deltacloud<br />
enables developers to only have to code towards one API," said Mark<br />
Worsey, CIO and EVP of Technology at GoGrid. "At GoGrid, we feel it is<br />
extremely important to continue openness within the cloud community and<br />
provide APIs that are accessible, useful and adopted by other 3rd party<br />
libraries like Deltacloud."</font></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="yiv1807539067MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3">"Deltacloud<br />
 is another example of how open source development continues to drive<br />
cloud innovation and development," said Tim Cramer, Vice President of<br />
Engineering at Eucalyptus Systems.</font></span></div>

 delivers an elegant ReST API, focused on exposing the differences<br />
between cloud services. jclouds and Deltacloud have a strong history<br />
together, starting with collaborating on abstraction design in 2009,<br />
spiking with our interface to Deltacloud released last year. I'm excited<br />
 to see Deltacloud's graduation, and looking forward to more shared code<br />
 this year,</font></span><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3">"</font></span><span style="font-family: 'sans-serif';"><font size="3"> said Adrian Cole, founder of jclouds.org and CTO jclouds at<br />

 proposed for development within the ASF by Lutterkort in May 2010,<br />
Deltacloud was seeded with code developed by Red Hat. Since then, the<br />
project has continued to innovate by expanding both its committer base<br />
and the diversity of clouds it can manage.</font></span></div>
