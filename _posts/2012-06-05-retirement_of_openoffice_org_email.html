  content: "@Scooter,\r\n\r\n\"Open Office\" was an informal way that many used to
    describe the project that was formally known as \"OpenOffice.org\".  Other informal
    names were \"OpenOffice\" and \"OOo\".  But the official name,  with the official
    registered trademark, was \"OpenOffice.org\".\r\n\r\nYou can still download OpenOffice.org,
    still use it, still get support for it, etc.  The only difference is the project
    is now at Apache, and the name has adapted to  the branding scheme used by Apache
    projects.  So we will be calling future versions \"Apache OpenOffice\".  Same
    code, same website, etc., but a new home and a new name.  "

<p>IF YOU HAVE AN OPENOFFCE.ORG EMAIL ADDRESS, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE</p>
<h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Background"></a>Background</h3>
<p>As you may have heard, Oracle contributed the OpenOffice.org (OOo)&nbsp;<br />
code to Apache in June. As part of this move, we will lose access to the<br />
 servers that formally hosted the OpenOffice.org website and various<br />
other online services associated with the project.&nbsp; Fortunately, the<br />
Apache OpenOffice project, working with the Apache Infrastructure Team,<br />
has been able to migrate most of these services to new servers, hosted<br />
by Apache.&nbsp; This includes critical services like version control,<br />
 downloads, website, wiki, bug tracking, user forums, etc. However, the email<br />
 forwarding service will not be among the services we preserve. The<br />
OpenOffice.org email forwarder will be terminated effective March 15th,<br />
2012.</p>
<h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Howthiswillimpactyou"></a>How this will impact you</h3>
<p>Starting on March 15th, 2012, emails sent to openoffice.org email<br />
addresses will stop forwarding.&nbsp; Senders will receive a bounce<br />
notification pointing them to an OpenOffice website with more<br />
information on the termination of openoffice.org email forwarding.&nbsp; No<br />
personal information about you will be shared with anyone. &nbsp; If the<br />
sender already knows an alternative way to contact you, then they might<br />
resend their email to an alternative email address, or contact you via<br />
other means.&nbsp; We cannot control this.&nbsp; Many emails are automated, and there is no human at<br />
the other end to react to such bounce notices.&nbsp; In those cases you will<br />
not receive the emails and may not even know that you have missed an<br />
email.&nbsp; So we recommend that you not rely on senders reacting to the<br />
bounce notification. Instead you should proactively reach out to correspondents<br />
to notify them that your email address is changing.</p>
<h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Whatyoushoulddo"></a>What you should do</h3>
<p>If you have an openoffice.org email address then you should take the following steps well in advance of March 15th, 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact those with whom you have shared your openoffice email<br />
address and let them know to use a different address to contact you.</li>
<li>If you have subscribed to mailing lists using your openoffice.org<br />
address, then unsubscribe from your openoffice.org address and<br />
resubscribe with another address</li>
<li>If you have used your openoffice.org address as a registration<br />
address for an online service, then log in to that account and change<br />
your address.</li>
<li>If you list your openoffice.org email address on your webpage or in your profile page, then update that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some special instructions for OpenOffice-related services:</p>
<ul>
<li>To update the email address used with your Bugzilla account, follow the instructions <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Update+OOo+Bugzilla+account+to+Apache+OpenOffice+Bugzilla">here</a>.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Update+OOo+Bugzilla+account+to+Apache+OpenOffice+Bugzilla" class="external-link"></a></li>
<li>To update the email address used with your OpenOffice.org wiki account, follow these instructions:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Main_Page">Log in</a> to the wiki.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external-link"></a></li>
<li>Select the "my preferences" link at the top of the page.&nbsp; You<br />
should be seeing the "User Profile" tab by default; if not, select that<br />
tab.</li>
<li>Change your email address, and save your change.&nbsp; A large notice will appear, about the confirmation email.</li>
<li>You will get an email at your new address.&nbsp; You must click on the<br />
"confirm" link to complete the change.&nbsp; You should see a wiki Special<br />
Page, confirming that your new address is verified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you are subscribed to a ezmlm mailing list, such as ooo-dev,<br />
ooo-users, or ooo-marketing, then you will need to unsubscribe from the<br />
list from your old address and resubscribe with your new address.&nbsp; More information on working with the mailing lists can be found <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/mailing-lists.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you have an account on our <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/">Extensions</a> or <a href="http://templates.services.openoffice.org/">Templates</a> website, then please login to that account and follow the given instructions for converting your account over to the new SourceForge hosted authentication. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset your password, but you need to do that immediately, before March 16th.&nbsp; Also, if you received an email from <a href="mailto:communityteam@sourceforge.net">communityteam@sourceforge.net</a> providing you with instructions to retain access to the OpenOffice Extensions and Templates website you can trust that source.&nbsp; It is not a "phishing" attack.</li>
</ul>
