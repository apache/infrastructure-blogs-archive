While much of this is social, it&#39;s also an opportunity to collaborate in person on the code. We will have a open collaboration space, with network and power, and tables for your project to gather around to work. Signs will be available to indicate what project you&#39;re working on, so that people will know which table to join.&nbsp; Having a clear set of objectives is key to getting everyone focused around the same thing, and is also a great way to attract new members to your community. When they can see what you&#39;ll be working on, and give it some thought ahead of time, new community members feel more welcome to participate once they get there.&nbsp; To this end, we encourage you to talk about this in your community, and then add your thoughts to the public etherpad&nbsp; so that we can help you promote your project&#39;s objectives. This further encourages cross pollination between projects, as we start to see what one another is working on.&nbsp;" />
