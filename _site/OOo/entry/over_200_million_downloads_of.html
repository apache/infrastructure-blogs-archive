<meta name="description" content="Apache OpenOffice continues to enjoy the user&#39;s valuation. Recently the new record mark of 200 million downloads was reached. The downloads are managed by our partner SourceForge . The high demand of the most current release 4.1.3 - that was released in October - is an acknowledgment of the previous work and a great motivation for the future. The ongoing trust of our users is also a thankful expression to all people who put their personal spare time and effort into the project and software. But of course there are more ways to distribute Apache OpenOffice. The most common one is to download the binary packages from one of the many mirror servers. But also printed magazines with an included DVD are possible, you can get it from your neighbors, friends, coworkers, it&#39;s part of free software collections, and many more ways we can think of. You don&#39;t need a permission or even registration to use or copy Apache OpenOffice as it is free and open source software. However, this makes it also difficult to get meaningful numbers of actual users. It&#39;s not measurable if a download stands for a single user or an installation in a larger network. Furthermore it&#39;s not known if Apache OpenOffice was downloaded the first time or it&#39;s an update for a previous installed version. Much more interesting to know is that the statistics show a steady download of 100,000 every day. It&#39;s safe to say that Apache OpenOffice has one of the highest user base in the world of free software projects. And for this we want to say Thank You!" />
