  content: My hat is off to everyone who has made this project successful.  Open Office
    saved me so much time as it has capabilities that big brother word processing
    will not use and confounds people's ability to get things done without paying
    more and more... then getting locked into their business contributing without
    thinking anymore just giving.  Time to give to Apache.  And also thank you for
    working with CC Wikki allowing me to get AutoCAD Civil 3D and other things after
    being sabotaged by a re-seller.  I am putting this out there.  I need someone
    to help me track down three viruses origin that destroyed my ability to work as
    a civil engineer.  I am a registered civil engineer and would appreciate a really
    intelligent programmer to help me regain my life and family.  If you think you
    can help email me at gmail and caption "Virus Tracker" so it will be noticeable
    to me.  Thank you all so much again for all the hard unrewarded work you have
    done.
