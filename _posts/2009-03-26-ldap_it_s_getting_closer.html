<p>As of this afternoon whilst at <a href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="'times new roman', times, serif">ApacheCon Europe 2009</font></a>, we have gotten our initial LDAP platform in place ready for testing. &nbsp;This will allow us to move to a centralized AAA system.&nbsp;</p>
