<p>Remain calm.</p>
<p>What we've learned about the heartbleed incident is that it is hard, in the sense of perhaps only viable to a well-funded blackhat operation, to steal a private certificate and key from a vulnerable service. &nbsp;Nevertheless, the central role Apache projects play in the modern software development world require us to mitigate against that circumstance. &nbsp;Given the length of time and exposure window for this bug's existence, we have to assume that some/many Apache passwords may have been compromised, and perhaps even our private wildcard cert and key, so we've taken a few steps as of today:</p></p>
<ol>
<li>We fixed the vulnerability in our openssl installations to prevent further damage,</li>
<li>We've acquired a new wildcard cert for apache.org that we have rolled out prior to this blog entry,</li>
<li>We will require that all committers rotate their LDAP passwords (committers visit <a href="https://id.apache.org/reset/enter">id.apache.org</a> to reset LDAP passwords once they've been forcibly reset),</li>
<li>We are encouraging all service administrators to all non-LDAP service like jira to rotate those passwords as well.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>Regarding the cert change for svn users- we'd also like to suggest that you remove your existing apache.org certs from your .subversion cache to prevent potential MITM attacks using the old cert. &nbsp;Fortunately it is relatively painless to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;% grep -l apache.org ~/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/* | xargs rm</p></p>
<p>NOTE: our openoffice wildcard cert was never vulnerable to this issue as it was served from an openssl-1.0.0 host.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div></p>
