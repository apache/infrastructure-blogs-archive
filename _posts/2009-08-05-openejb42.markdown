As you state quite well, Mangus, many people have had a bad experience with EJB 2.1 and although simpler EJB 3.0 is not so easily testable without a container.  Unless of course you use an embedded EJB container like OpenEJB.

We greatly appreciate blog posts like yours as many people try and fail with a few approaches before finally finding OpenEJB.  So many more people don't even look for a solution.  Blog posts like yours go a long way in helping to get the word out.

Thanks, Magnus!
