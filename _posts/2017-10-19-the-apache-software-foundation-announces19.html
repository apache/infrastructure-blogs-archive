<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;19 October 2017&mdash;</strong> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the five-year anniversary of Apache<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>OpenOffice&trade;, the leading Open Source office document productivity suite.</div>

<div>"OpenOffice has been downloaded by millions of users since becoming an Apache project five years ago," said Marcus Lange, Vice President of Apache OpenOffice.

We are inspired by their encouragement and thank them by making the next version of the world's leading Open Source productivity suite even better."</div>

</ol></div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div>In celebration of OpenOffice's triple anniversary this month &mdash;17 years as an Open Source project, 6 years at the ASF, and 5 years as an ASF Top-Level Project&mdash; the Apache OpenOffice Project Management Committee also announced the immediate availability of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4, which reflects changes that include:</div>
