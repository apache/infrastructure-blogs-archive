<p>14 June 2011 &mdash;FOREST HILL, MD&mdash;The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0.</p>
<div>Apache Traffic Server is a Cloud Computing "edge" service, able to handle requests in and out of the Cloud, both by serving static content (images, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files), and routing requests for dynamic content to a Web server (such as the Apache HTTP Server).</p>

<div>Apache Traffic Server is a fast, scalable, and extensible HTTP/1.1 compliant caching proxy server designed to improve:</p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Caching: improves response time while reducing server load and bandwidth needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested Web pages, images, and Web service calls;</div>

<div>&nbsp;- Speed: scales well on modern SMP hardware, handling tens of thousands of requests per second;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Extensibility: APIs allow for customized plug-ins, from modifying headers and content to implementing new protocol handlers;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Reliability: successfully handles hundreds of terrabytes of data, both as forward and reverse proxies</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Traffic Server v.3.0.0 has been benchmarked to handle more than of 200,000 requests per second -- a 277% improvement over v2.0&rsquo;s already-impressive rates.
