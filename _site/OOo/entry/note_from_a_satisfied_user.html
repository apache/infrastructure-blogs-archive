I understand that it is&nbsp; crucial to get as many users as possible, so I acknowledge the decisions&nbsp; towards MS Office. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt; What I like most is the long term usability&nbsp; and stability, and I do not only keep my office files from more than 10&nbsp; years ago, I also use and re-use them.
