As it turns out, there is a bug (well several) in the core pattern that renders the original substitution ineffective.&nbsp; However the impact on the taint-checked version causes the detainting match to fail and renders the script harmless!&nbsp; The practical difference is that instead of a script with a working remote shell exploit, we have script that serves no useful purpose.&nbsp; To the Apache sysadmins this is a superior outcome, even though to the developer the original, essentially working script is preferable- worlds are colliding here, but guess who wins? At the ASF the sysadmins almost invariably refuse to run perl or ruby CGI scripts without taint-checking enabled, and will always prefer CGI scripts be written in languages that support taint checks as they tend to enforce good practice in dealing with untrusted input.&nbsp; This example, which is in fact one of the first times we&#39;ve even considered allowing Apache devs to deploy non-download CGI scripts on the www.apache.org&nbsp; server, serves as a useful reminder to Apache devs as to why using languages that support taint checks is an essential component of scripting on the web." />
