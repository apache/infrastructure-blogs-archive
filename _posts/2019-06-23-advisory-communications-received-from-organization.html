<div>Some ApacheCon sponsors and members of the greater Apache community have reported that they have been contacted by a company called Global Expo Travel that is alleging to be affiliated with ApacheCon.</div>
<div></div>
<div>They are claiming to be "handling the travel" for ApacheCon North America.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This statement is 100% false. We do not know anyone at Global Expo Travel and have not contracted this company to conduct any business on behalf of ApacheCon or The Apache Software Foundation in any capacity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will not tolerate spoofing or related fraudulent activity in any form.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the event that you have received any telephone calls or emails from any organization other than the ASF (from @apache.org) or the ApacheCon conference producers</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Inc. for ApacheCon North America</li>
<li>New Thinking/Plain Schwartz for ApacheCon Europe</li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>... please notify us at planners(at)apachecon(dot)com. If available, please include the originating telephone number and/or full email headers and any message(s) if possible.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any ApacheCon sponsor needing assistance is welcome to contact their respective Event Sponsor Ambassador, namely, Daniel Ruggeri for ApacheCon North America, and Sharan Foga for ApacheCon Europe.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We appreciate your vigilance and cooperation in helping keep our community protected from deceitful practices and malicious entities. We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas and Berlin.</div>
<div></div>
