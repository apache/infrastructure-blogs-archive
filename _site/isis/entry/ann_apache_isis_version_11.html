<div></div>
<div>Similar to the way in which Apache Wicket has an additional "wicketstuff" website [9], we have now set up a new companion website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isisaddons.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">www.isisaddons.org</a>&nbsp;[<wbr />10]. &nbsp;The intention is for this site to house various third-party extensions to Isis, such that they can either be used "out-of-the-box", or be forked and extended as need be.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Currently Isis add-ons fall into two categories:</div>
</p></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">* modules... these provide business functionality to be incorporated directly into your domain object model, usually as domain services, occasionally with supporting entities. &nbsp;Examples include mail merge, spreadsheets, tags/labels.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">* wicket extensions ... these extend the capability of the Wicket viewer, eg maps, calendars, charts.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">In the future we expect to add in "metamodel" category for customizations to Isis' metamodel, eg an extension to leverage various Java 8 reflection features which we don't want to roll into Isis core just yet.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The intention is for all modules in <a href="http://www.isisaddons.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">www.isisaddons.org</a> to follow a standard format, and include full unit and integration testing. &nbsp;Thus, if you want to fork and extend any given module, then there is a solid base to start from. &nbsp;Over time we hope that the "modules" in particular will provide a useful catalog to help bootstrap Isis development, and provide a way for the community to contribute back their own functionality as modules.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">We are also considering moving some of Isis' own modules (ie those recently factored out, such as for auditing, command, publishing etc) into <a href="http://www.isisaddons.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">www.isisaddons.org</a>. &nbsp;Doing so will reduce the size of Isis itself while making it possible for these components to be more easily extended/adapted by the user community as need be. &nbsp;We will certainly take a *copy* of these modules in the first instance.</div>

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Note that some Maven modules have been renamed, added or removed. &nbsp;While every effort has been made to minimize impact (in particular: no classes have been deleted or have changed their package), there are necessarily some changes that must be made to existing application pom.xml files.</div>
