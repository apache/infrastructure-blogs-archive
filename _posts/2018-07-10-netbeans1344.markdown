<p>We're currently running two processes, both of which it would be great if everyone would participate in -- and in fact it's really important that everyone does these two things:</p>

<ol>

<li>Vote in the PPMC thread:

<p><a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a644bb8e3ba2cbd06328bb004f1b18b4171763cd3d78a9131615f687@%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E">https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a644bb8e3ba2cbd06328bb004f1b18b4171763cd3d78a9131615f687@%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E</a></p>

<p>Doing the above means more than putting a +1, it means downloading the sources, building them, looking at keys, etc, as described above.</p></li>

<li>Fill out the Community Acceptance survey, which is focused on the functionality (versus the sources, which is what the PPMC thread is about), which takes about 5 minutes:

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw1WT1HDjR-nPMcXn8gBCQXk5k3IiXSoXW85FZezaPQQzGTQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw1WT1HDjR-nPMcXn8gBCQXk5k3IiXSoXW85FZezaPQQzGTQ/viewform
</a></p>

<p>The Community Acceptance Survey runs until Sunday the 22nd of July. Issues found in the meantime will hopefully not be critical and not require a new voting candidate, but we'll need to see how things go and nothing can be guaranteed here of course -- i.e., someone could find a blocker of some kind during the community acceptance survey process.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Hopefully, nothing going wrong and everything going well, we'll then be at a point to start the IPMC vote thread on the 23rd and, if everything goes well, release Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 at the beginning of August.</p>

<p>After that we'll work on the 2nd donation, relicensing it, moving it into master etc.</p>
