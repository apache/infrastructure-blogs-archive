<p>Not only does the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" title="Apache HTTP Server">Apache HTTP Server</a> power <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/04/06/april_2009_web_server_survey.html" title="Netcraft Survey">more<br />
than 106 million Websites</a> worldwide, an astounding 89% of Linux<br />
Journal readers have chosen the &ldquo;competitor-less&rdquo; Apache HTTP Server as their<br />
favorite Web server, according to the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-journal-announces-winners-its-2009-readers-choice-awards" title="Linux Journal Reader's Choice Awards">2009<br />
Reader&rsquo;s Choice Awards</a>.</p>
<p>We were tickled to read, &ldquo;As with last year, the thought<br />
arises in Favorite Web Server category of whether we should just ask &lsquo;Do you<br />
use the Apache Web server, yes or no?&rsquo; and leave it at that.&rdquo; According to<br />
Associate Publisher Mark Irgang, &ldquo;Apache is always in there.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Congratulations to the Apache<br />
HTTP Server Project for more than 16 years of technical<br />
excllence!</p>
