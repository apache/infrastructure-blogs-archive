<div><b><i>Highly-Performant Cloud Computing Service Serves Dynamic Content, Billions of Objects, and Terrabytes of Data for Large-Scale Deployments</i></b></div> 
  <p>14 June 2011 —FOREST HILL, MD—The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0.</p> 
  <div>Apache Traffic Server is a Cloud Computing &quot;edge&quot; service, able to handle requests in and out of the Cloud, both by serving static content (images, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files), and routing requests for dynamic content to a Web server (such as the Apache HTTP Server).<br /><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Traffic Server is battle hardened, serving terrabytes of data in real-life deployments where immediate content delivery is critical,&quot; said Apache Traffic Server Vice President Leif Hedstrom. &quot;V3.0.0 builds upon that foundation, with new features and functionality, improved efficiency and performance, increased uptime, and overall easier to use.”</div> 
  <div><br />Apache Traffic Server is a fast, scalable, and extensible HTTP/1.1 compliant caching proxy server designed to improve:<br /><br /></div> 
  <div>&nbsp;- Caching: improves response time while reducing server load and bandwidth needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested Web pages, images, and Web service calls;</div> 
  <div>&nbsp;- Proxying: easily add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add load balancing by adding a proxy layer;</div> 
  <div>&nbsp;- Speed: scales well on modern SMP hardware, handling tens of thousands of requests per second;</div> 
  <div>&nbsp;- Extensibility: APIs allow for customized plug-ins, from modifying headers and content to implementing new protocol handlers;</div> 
  <div>&nbsp;- Reliability: successfully handles hundreds of terrabytes of data, both as forward and reverse proxies</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>Apache Traffic Server v.3.0.0 has been benchmarked to handle more than of 200,000 requests per second -- a 277% improvement over v2.0’s already-impressive rates. Used in production in a variety of large-scale deployments, companies such as Yahoo! rely on Apache Traffic Server to handle over 400 terrabytes of traffic, and has used the project to serve more than 30 billion objects daily across its various properties including the Yahoo! homepage, and its Sports, Mail, and Finance sites.</div> 
  <div><br />Apache Traffic Server entered the Apache Incubator in June 2009, graduated as an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP) in April 2010, and released v2.0 the following month.

  <p><b>Availability and Oversight<br /></b>As with all Apache products, Apache Traffic Server software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project’s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Apache Traffic Server source code, documentation, and related resources are available at <a href="http://trafficserver.apache.org/">http://trafficserver.apache.org/</a>.</p> 
  <p><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)<br /></b>Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as &quot;The Apache Way,&quot; more than 300 individual Members and 2,500 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US 501(3)(c) not-for-profit charity, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including AMD, Basis Technology, Cloudera, Facebook, Google, IBM, HP, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, SpringSource, Talend, and Yahoo!.
