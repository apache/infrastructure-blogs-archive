<h3>Apache OFBiz&nbsp;17.12.04 Released!</h3>
<p>During this month the community announced the release of 17.12.04.<br />
The new release consolidates all work done since the previous release in April 2020. The release file can be downloaded following the instructions in the&nbsp;<a href="https://ofbiz.apache.org/download.html" style="color: #1155cc;">OFBiz Downloads</a>&nbsp;page. Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://ofbiz.apache.org/release-notes-17.12.04.html" style="color: #1155cc;">Release Notes</a>&nbsp;for more details of the changes introduced with this new version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that a security vulnerability has been reported for the previous OFBiz releases. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to the 17.12.04 release to mitigate this vulnerability. Details can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ofbiz.apache.org/security.html" style="color: #1155cc;">Security</a>&nbsp;page, mail  <a href="https://markmail.org/message/vxzbxad2lr2zxw2d">thread1</a>, and <a href="https://markmail.org/message/ro4tdr2dpr2ixlfx" style="color: #1155cc;">thread2</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 the project, and also thanking them for all their contributions.<br></p>
<h3>Screen engine improvements<br></h3>
<p>During this month, the community discussed the proposal presentation by Nicolas Malin to homogenize and empower the<br>screen<br />
 engine. The changes aim to improve the end-user experience on the<br />
back-office screen and designed to decrease the XML form definition,<br />
based upon the functional concept of various technologies.<br>Here are some links for more insights:<br></p>

<h3>Ongoing efforts to fix lint issues<br></h3>
<p>Linting is the software<br />
engineering practice involving automated checking of source code for<br />
programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.<br />
This is achieved by using a lint tool or linter which is basically a<br />
static code analyzer. During this month, the community discussed fixing<br />
various issues identified using the linting tool <a href="https://checkstyle.org/" target="_blank">checkstyle</a> available with OFBiz as <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html" target="_blank">Gradle plugin</a>.<br>Here are some links for more insights:<br></p>
