<p>The Apache NetBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0.</p>
<p><b>Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 constitutes all the modules in the Apache NetBeans Git repo, which together provide the NetBeans Platform (i.e., the underlying application framework), as well as all the modules that provide the Java SE-related features of Apache NetBeans. In short, Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 is a full IDE for Java SE development.</b></p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: Apache NetBeans is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache<br />
Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.<br />
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further<br />
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision<br />
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other<br />
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a<br />
reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does<br />
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</i></p>
