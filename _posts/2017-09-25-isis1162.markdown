  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>There are also a small number of new features:</div> 
  <div> 
    <ul> 
      <li>a new Markup value type that allows the Wicket viewer to display arbitrary HTML</li> 
      <li>a new &quot;layout&quot; URL for the Restful Objects viewer</li> 
      <li>a new &quot;logout&quot; page for the Wicket viewer to support monitoring tools.</li> 
    </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div><br /></div>
