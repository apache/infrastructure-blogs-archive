<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">The following newsworthy events took<br />
place during the course of ApacheCon North America 1-5 November:</p></p>
<p><b>1) Foundation Updates</b></p>
<p><u>Membership count</u>: 330 (31 new Members; 52<br />
emeritus)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><u>Committer count</u>: +2,500 (approximately<br />
200 additional Committers over the past year) </p>
<p>The ASF is governed by the community it most directly serves -- the people collaborating within its projects. Apache Committers are developers who contribute (individuals who "commit" or "write" code, patches, or documentation) directly to the Apache code repository. Apache Members are Committers who have demonstrated merit in the Foundation&rsquo;s growth, evolution, and progress, and have been nominated for and elected to be awarded ASF Membership by existing Members. ASF Members have the right to vote on community-related decisions; and and the ability propose an active user for Committership.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><u>Sponsors</u>: the ASF welcomed new Sponsors<br />
AMD and IBM at the Gold level, and Lucid Imagination at the Bronze<br />
level.</p>
