    there be a need for the Client to store certificates?

<p>My first draft for this blog had a very extensive introduction about AMQP, its benefits, how business manager X would preserve its investment and blablablablaba...
<p>Lets say I cut all that #@!# and I'm jumping right to the good stuff:</p>
<p><b>AMQP is cool</b>, full of Libraries that you can bring to use with <b>ActiveMQ Artemis</b>.</p></p>
<p>One of the Libraries you can use is the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite/">AMQPLite with .NET</a></p>
<p>If you just want to read the code, i have recently added the <a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/tree/master/examples/protocols/amqp/dotnet">.NET Example on Artemis</a>, which is pretty much what I'm describing here</p>
<p>Let me give you a cooking recipe on how to write a .NET application and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis</p>
<p>Let's do it!</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> - Install .NET</p>
<p>There is this fun video explaining how to do it. My teenager daughter would definitely be able to follow this:<br />
<br/><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core">https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core</a></p>
<p>There is also a video showing how to do it on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core-on-MacOS">Mac</a> and <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-Csharp-dotnet-Core-Ubuntu">Linux</a></p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> - Write the code</p>
<p>I basically followed the steps here on this hello world app:<br />
<br/><a href="https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite/blob/master/docs/articles/hello_amqp.md">https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite/blob/master/docs/articles/hello_amqp.md</a></p>
<p>The main pitfall I had since I was very rusty on .NET was to install the AMQP.net library accordingly:</p>
<p>But I reckon it was my fault, although I could fix it in 10 min by adding this to the project.json:</p>
<pre>
"dependencies": {"AMQPNetLite": "1.2.2"},
</pre>
<p>Here is the code I have:</p>
<pre>
using System;
using Amqp;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
             string address = "amqp://a:a@localhost:5672";

            Connection connection = new Connection(new Address(address));
            Session session = new Session(connection);
            SenderLink sender = new SenderLink(session, "test-sender", "q1");

            Message message1 = new Message("Hello AMQP!");
            sender.Send(message1);


            Console.WriteLine("Message sent into queue q1");
       }
    }
}
</pre>
<p><b>Step 3</b> - Create an Artemis Broker and run it</p>
<p>./artemis create /tmp/myBroker</p>
<pre>
./artemis create /tmp/mybroker
Creating ActiveMQ Artemis instance at: /private/tmp/mybroker

--user: is a mandatory property!
Please provide the default username:
a

--password: is mandatory with this configuration:
Please provide the default password:


--role: is a mandatory property!
Please provide the default role:
a

--allow-anonymous | --require-login: is a mandatory property!
Allow anonymous access? (Y/N):
y

Auto tuning journal ...
done! Your system can make 25 writes per millisecond, your journal-buffer-timeout will be 40000

You can now start the broker by executing:  

   "/private/tmp/mybroker/bin/artemis" run

Or you can run the broker in the background using:

   "/private/tmp/mybroker/bin/artemis-service" start
</pre>
<p><p><b>Finally:</b> run the thing:</p>
<p># this will install dependencies<br/>dotnet restore</p>
<pre>
log  : Restoring packages for /work/apache/six/artemis-distribution/target/apache-artemis-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/apache-artemis-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/examples/dotnet/amqp/queue/project.json...

log  : Restore completed in 741ms.
</pre>
<p># this will run the code<br/>dotnet run</p>
<pre>
Project dotnet (.NETCoreApp,Version=v1.1) will be compiled because expected outputs are missing
Compiling dotnet for .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.1

Compilation succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time elapsed 00:00:00.9060278
 

Message sent into queue q1

</pre>
<p>All of this can be done with both Artemis and ActiveMQ Classic </p>
<p>AMQP is a quite powerful and you can reuse your client libraries any way you want.</p>
