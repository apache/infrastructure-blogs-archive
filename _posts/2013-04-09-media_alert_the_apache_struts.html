<div><b><i>Apache Struts 2 recommended as an elegant Open Source, extensible successor framework for creating enterprise-ready Java Web applications</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;9 April 2013&ndash;</b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHO:</b> The Apache Software Foundation's Apache Struts Project, creators of leading Open Source solutions for creating Java web applications.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHAT:</b> The Struts&trade; 1.x Web framework has reached its end-of-life (EOL) and is no longer officially supported.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Created in 2000 to provide an improved development experience over pure Java Server Pages (JSP) utilization, Apache Struts 1 soon became the de-facto standard for Java-based Web application development. Numerous companies world-wide adopted Struts 1 as a strategic platform, even after JSF (Java Server Faces) was introduced as a standardized Java EE framework for Web application development. Its popularity was so prevalent in the early 2000s, most job offerings in the space of Java-based Web technology required Struts 1 as a must-have skill.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today, many important Websites and Web-based user interfaces continue to rely on Struts 1 technology. In addition, many popular Web frameworks, such as Spring MVC and WebWork, were significantly inspired by Struts 1.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHEN:</b> The Apache Struts Project Management Committee is not aware of any urgent issues posing the immediate need to eliminate Struts 1 usage. However, the project's EOL status signifies that security and bug fixes will no longer be provided effective immediately.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Apache Struts project recommends new projects to be developed using Struts 2 as opposed to Struts 1. While any action-based Java web framework is a potential candidate to re-use Struts 1 architectural experience or migrate existing Struts-1-based applications, users are highly advised to investigate Struts 2 as a successor framework.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHY:</b> Struts 2 is modern, highly decoupled, feature rich, well maintained, and successfully running in many mission-critical projects globally. It shares the same basic principles with Struts 1, and offers a highly improved architecture, API, and solution portfolio.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHERE:</b> The last release of Apache Struts 1 is version 1.3.10 from December 2008. All software downloads, notices, and updates are available at the Apache Struts project homepage at <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">http://struts.apache.org/</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>NEXT STEPS:</b> The Struts community continues its focus on pushing the Apache Struts 2 framework forward, with as many as 23 releases to date.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Availability and Oversight</b></div>
<div>Apache Struts software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Apache Struts source code, documentation, mailing lists, and related resources are available at <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">http://struts.apache.org/</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</b></div>
