<p>The Apache OpenWebBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache Meecrowave 1.0.0</p> 
  <p>Apache Meecrowave is a small server based on </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Apache Tomcat (Servlets)</li> 
    <li>Apache OpenWebBeans (CDI)</li> 
    <li>Apache Johnzon (JSON-P and JSON-B), and<br /></li> 
    <li>Apache CXF (JAX-RS).&nbsp;</li> 
  </ul>That means it is ideally suited for Microservices and standalone applications. 
  
  <p>Meecrowave can be either started via a maven plugin (for ease of development), programmatically as embedded server, bundled as application with your business code or as runner to start up portable WAR or JAR applications. </p> 
  <p>The source distribution package can be downloaded from our mirrors: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/openwebbeans/meecrowave/1.0.0</p> 
  <p>Hashes can be found here

  <p>The binary artifacts are available on maven.central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/meecrowave/</p>
