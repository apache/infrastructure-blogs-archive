    Will everyone using ASF code for commercial uses or distributing it as part of
    a product one day find themselves having to fork over Big Bucks in licensing fees?
    Current code is probably safe from this, but what about new versions produced
    sometime in the future? Hmm...

  content: Interesting.  I think most folks who contributed code to Apache projects
    did so with the intention of it being free and open for everyone.  Now that this
    has been compromised, it shows that there was no real contractual commitment on
    Apache's part to uphold this, even if contributors had to sign an agreement.  I
    realize now this means that Apache can profit off of our contributions, with contributors
    not getting any share.  Perhaps this is the end of truly "free" open source software.  It's
    a sad world...though perhaps not for Microsoft who pointed out earlier on that
    there's no such thing as "free".

    those projects that are driven not by passion but by a need to make a living.

<p>Today, the Apache Software Foundation announced it has agreed to<br />
sell all IP and assets of the foundation to Oracle. The agreement is<br />
a $1.5 billion all cash deal. The ASF board agreed to the terms<br />
after vigorous discussions last evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"We never considered the possibility of selling the ASF," said Jim<br />
Jagielski, Chairman of the ASF, "but Oracle made us a simply fantastic<br />
offer. Larry himself flew out last week to meet with us to address<br />
our concerns."</p>
<p>
As part of the agreement, Oracle obtains even more of the crucial<br />
LAMP-stack software products.</p>
<p>"It was Oracle's admission that the Web is more than 'just' Java<br />
or databases that finalized the decision for us," said Justin Erenkrantz,<br />
Director and President of the ASF.</p>
<p>
2009 marked the 10th Anniversary of the ASF.</p>
<p>We will be communicating updates about the status of our projects and our license in the near future.&nbsp; As a community based organization, we want to ensure the best experience for our existing committers, contributors, and users, under our new arrangement.</p>
