<h2 id="the-april-2014-deadline">The April 2014 deadline</h2>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx">announced</a><br />
 that they will end support of Office 2003 and Windows XP on April<br />
8th, 2014.  What does this mean?  As they describe,<br />
"After April 8, 2014, there will be no new security updates,<br />
non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options or online<br />
technical content updates."  This,<br />
according to Microsoft, exposes Office 2003 users to greater "Security<br />
&amp; Compliance Risks".</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-alternatives">Time to explore the alternatives</h2>
<p>Some companies and users will write a big check to Microsoft for an upgraded license for Office.  But<br />
others will see this as an opportunity<br />
to explore the alternatives, including open source products like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache<br />
OpenOffice</a>, the leading free productivity suite, with over 44 million downloads.&nbsp;  Now is a good time to start planning for a migration off<br />
of Microsoft Office 2003 and Windows XP.  Many companies have already<br />
started.</p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice is available on Windows, MacOS and Linux.&nbsp; It is open source software, which means there are no license or subscription fees required to use or redistribute OpenOffice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can learn more about Apache OpenOffice at <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">www.openoffice.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many companies offer migration services for Apache OpenOffice, some of which are listed on our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bizdev/consultants.html">consultants page</a>.</p>
