  content: "@Mack,  LibreOffice was not mentioned at all in this blog post.  What
    are *you* complaining about?  We have many projects that are based on Apache OpenOffice
    code, including independent BSD, Solaris, OS/2 and Android ports, a portable version
    (winPenPack) that runs from USB drives and, of course, LibreOffice.  Several,
    but not all of them, already contribute patches up stream to us.  All of them
    are invited to contribute.  This is a standard part of the FOSS ethic and should
    not be seen as controversial.\n"

    a year.  They are not waiting for us to approve anything on the Apache side.\r\n\r\nBut
    note that there is another portable applications project, winPenPack, that has
    a portable version of Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.winpenpack.com/en/download.php?view.1341"

  content: "In my previous assignment which extended 5 plus years, used open office
    due to its fully funtional user interface and features which were not available
    in other programs which I will not take the liberty of naming here. \r\nOur company
    found the program to be extremely useful and containing same, and additional,easy
    to use options. Some of which are not available in MS office, and are easier to
    navigate when using open office when using compound properties of hte program.\r\n\r\n

  content: "Just to say a big thank you for the great work.\r\nWe, as blind people,
    are until now quite tied to MSOffice for a real productivity suite, and with the
    ribon menus it becomes a nightmare. not to mention the license prices !\r\nHope
    OOO 4.1 will be able to expose the accessibility features even if running from
    a pen drive. imagine the potential then...\r\nMy only contribution can be a bit
    of money. I'm going to see how to donnate.\r\n"

  content: "I do not understand why you still complain that LibreOffice uses your
    code under your license.\r\n\r\nYou posted showing that you have all brand recognition.\r\n\r\nYou
    posted showing that you have much more downloads.\r\n\r\nRob wrote a series of
    posts showing that LibreOffice has no significant number of developers, and OpenOffice
    is widely supported and sponsored.\r\n\r\nPeople who mention LibreOffice in Bugzilla
    are told to stop mentioning that program.\r\n\r\nYou post many times why no-one
    should take notice of LibreOffice. So why do you still continue talk about them?"

  content: I am trying to insert text over a pic, no matter what I do the text will
    not all fit on the page.  For some reason it enlarges.  I am so frustrated that
    I have to post this somewhere.  I used other programs for this sort of thing,
    but this is the worst one that I have worked with so far.  I have been trying
    to do this for 2 hours already ...sickening.....

  content: Most people probably aren't aware of the significance of this. It goes
    a long way toward breaking the screenreader monopoly; a "killer app" of JFW is
    its office intigration. Having a viable free alternative that all people can access
    is awesome and empowers a great deal of indeviduals.

    with it. Integrated support for those interfaces is a great news. Thank you for
    all your work.\r\n\r\nOn the side note someone should clean up the posts in the
    addons section. Some of them are as stupid as the ones on Youtube, which I never
    thought would be possible."

<p>
The Apache OpenOffice project is pleased to announce that it has successfully integrated support for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373592%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Microsoft Active Accessibility</a> (MSAA) and <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2">IAccessible2</a> interfaces.&nbsp; Support for these interfaces enables screen readers and other assistive technologies to work with Apache OpenOffice, which in turn enables greater productivity by OpenOffice users who are blind or who have low-vision.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The new accessibility code, based on the donation of IBM's <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/merging_lotus_symphony_allegro_moderato">Lotus Symphony</a>, will now undergo extensive testing.&nbsp; The plan is to ship the new accessibility support in Apache OpenOffice 4.1, early in 2014.&nbsp; With this support added Apache OpenOffice, the leading open source productivity suite, also becomes the most accessible one.</p>
<p>The IAccessible2 interface was developed as a superset of MSAA interfaces, to enable enhanced support for document editors,&nbsp; including support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, etc., while allowing assistive technology developers to preserve their existing investment in MSAA support.&nbsp; IAccessible2 is supported by assistive technologies such as JAWS, MAGic, Window-Eyes, NVDA and ZoomText.</p>
<p>As we did with the award-winning <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/the_sidebar_new_and_improved">Side Panel</a> UI in Apache OpenOffice 4.0, and all other features we develop, we will publish the IAccessible2 code under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License 2.0</a>.&nbsp; This allows anyone to use, copy and redistribute OpenOffice freely.&nbsp; The license also allows others to take our source code, integrate it into their products and develop it further.&nbsp; That is what open source is all about.&nbsp; In a healthy open source ecosystem code flows in both directions.&nbsp; A new feature is developed in OpenOffice, and the code is taken by downstream consumers.&nbsp; As that code is tested further ("Every new class of users finds a new class of bugs") and fixes are made, these fixes should be contributed upstream.&nbsp; This reduces future merge costs for the downstream consumer.&nbsp; It is also the right thing to do, to help improve the code that your project benefits from and which your users depend upon.&nbsp; We invite all downstream consumers to engage with the Apache OpenOffice project, especially those that have so far neglected to do so, in order to improve the accessibility code that is of mutual benefit and that is so critical for the open source community.&nbsp; Help your neighbor.&nbsp; Be a hacker, not a hoarder.&nbsp; Our website has further information on <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/contributing-code.html">how to contribute patches</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to receive notification of when Apache OpenOffice 4.1 is available you can sign up for our announcements mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:announce-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">announce-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheOO">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/apacheoo">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+openoffice/">Google+</a>.&nbsp; If you want to help test the new accessibility support, before it is released, you can send a note to our QA mailing list to learn more:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:qa@openoffice.apache.org">qa@openoffice.apache.org</a>.</p>
