<div style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; "> 
    <p>Just to say that InfoQ have posted an article [1] that introduces the Restful Objects spec [2],&nbsp;and its two implementations, Apache Isis [3] being one of them.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; ">Restful Objects is all about providing a hypermedia API from a domain model. &nbsp;In the case of Isis, this is done automatically, leveraging its internal metamodel. &nbsp;</div> 
  <div style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; "> 
    <p>Because Restful Objects is a spec, it also opens up possibilities for independently developed clients (eg Javascript) and server implementations; indeed this is already happening and has brought some &quot;new blood&quot; into our community. &nbsp;</p> 
    <p>Anyway, if the idea of marrying up REST and domain models&nbsp;sounds of interest, check out the article.</p>
