    <p><font face="monospace" size="4"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is proud to announce that it has been ratified for another three-year term on the Java Community Process (JCP) Executive Committee. Receiving support from 95% of the voters, this election allows the ASF to continue its 10 year effort to help bring transparency and openness to the JCP as well as ensure that Java specifications are able to be independently implemented&nbsp;and distributed under open source licenses.</span></font><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><font face="monospace" size="4"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">We are grateful for the strong support from the community, and believe it is a validation of the work&nbsp;the ASF is doing in the JCP. Our efforts to transform the JCP into a truly open specification ecosystem help strengthen the value of Java for everyone -- for implementors of open source projects such as those found at the ASF and elsewhere, for students, educators and academics using Java for teaching&nbsp;and research, for independent software vendors that build innovative products and services on Java, and for commercial users in all areas of economic activity that depend on Java to run and grow their businesses.</span></font><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><font face="monospace" size="4"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">Through the JSPA, the agreement under which both Oracle and the ASF participate in the JCP, the ASF has been entitled to a license for the test kit for Java SE (the &quot;TCK&quot;) that will allow the ASF to test and distribute a release of the Apache Harmony project under the Apache License.&nbsp;Oracle is violating their contractual obligation as set forth under the rules of the JCP by only offering a TCK license that imposes additional terms and conditions that are not compatible with open source or Free software licenses.&nbsp;The ASF believes that any specification lead that doesn't follow the JCP rules should not be able to participate as a member in good standing, and we have exercised our votes on JSRs -- our only real power on the JCP -- accordingly.&nbsp; We have voted against Sun starting and continuing JSRs, and have made it clear that we would vote against the JSR for Java SE 7 for&nbsp;these reasons.</span></font><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><font face="monospace" size="4"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">In light of Oracle Corporation failing to uphold their responsibilities as a Specification Lead under the JSPA&nbsp;and breaking their signed covenants with the Apache Software Foundation that are the conditions under which we&nbsp;agreed to participate in the JCP, we call upon the Executive Committee of the JCP to continue its clear, strong and public support for Java as an open specification ecosystem that is a level playing field for participants in order to ensure that anyone -- any individual or commercial, academic or non-profit entity -- is able to&nbsp;implement and distribute Java specifications under terms of their choice. Specifically, we encourage the other members of the JCP EC to continue with their support of our position regarding Oracle, and vote accordingly on the upcoming Java SE 7 vote.</span></font><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; " /><font face="monospace" size="4"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; ">The ASF will terminate its relationship with the JCP if our rights as implementers of Java specifications are not upheld by the JCP Executive Committee to the limits of the EC's ability. The lack of active, strong&nbsp;and clear enforcement of those rights implies that the JSPA agreements are worthless, confirming that JCP specifications are nothing more than proprietary documentation.</span></font></p>
