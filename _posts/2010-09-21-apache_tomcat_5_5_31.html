<p>The Apache Tomcat team has released 5.5.31. Tomcat 5.5.30 contained a couple of regressions (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49647">bug 49647</a> and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49718">bug 49718</a>) which broke JavaMail resources and HTTP 0.9 requests. Both of these issues are fixed in 5.5.31.</p>
<p>In addition, 5.5.31 contains a handful of bug fixes and enhancements. As always, the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/changelog.html">Tomcat 5.5 change log</a> has the details of all the fixes that went into this release and previous releases. </p>
<p>Tomcat 5.5.31 can be obtained from the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Tomcat 5.5.x download page</a>.</p>
