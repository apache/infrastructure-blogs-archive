Wakefield, MA &mdash;31 October 2018&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache&reg; Subversion&reg; v1.11.0, the latest version of the popular centralized software version control system.
