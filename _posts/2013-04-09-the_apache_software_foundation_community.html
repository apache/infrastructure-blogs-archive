<div><b><i>Hundreds of students mentored in "The Apache Way" of Open Source community leadership</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;9 April 2013&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)'s Community Development (ComDev) project today announced its acceptance into the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as a mentoring organization for the eighth consecutive year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ComDev team helps newcomers learn about the ASF's projects, governance, and activities, and guides them in becoming part of the meritocratic, all-volunteer Apache community.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Established in 2005, the Google Summer of Code offers student developers from around the world stipends to write code for various Open Source software projects over a three month period.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ASF has actively participated in GSoC since the program's inception, mentoring 30-45 students each year, and providing exposure to real-world software and community development "The Apache Way".</div>
<div></div>
<div>Countless GSoC students mentored by the Apache community continue to be long-term code committers on a variety of Apache projects. Some active program participants have even been elected as members of the ASF.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This year, dozens of Apache projects have committed to mentoring GSoC students. They include, but are not limited to, Accumulo, Airavata, Axiom, Bloodhound, CloudStack, CouchDB, Crunch, Giraph, Gora, Hama, Hive, Isis, Jena, Lenya, Lucene, Mahout, ManifoldCF, Mesos, Nutch, ODE, OpenMeetings, OpenOffice, Pig, Rat, SIS, Sling, Solr, Stanbol, Tika, VXQuery, Wookie, XalanJ, and XercesJ.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ComDev team recommends GSoC students to discuss ideas directly with all Apache project(s) of interest before the official start of the application phase on Monday, 22 April 2013. The ASF's more than 100 Top-Level Projects and nearly three dozen initiatives in the Apache Incubator are listed at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">http://incubator.apache.org/</a> respectively.</div>
