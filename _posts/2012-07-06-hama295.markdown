The Apache Hama PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Hama 0.5.0.

Apache Hama is a BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing framework
on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for massive scientific
computations such as matrix, graph and network algorithms.

This release is the first release as a top level project, contains two
significant new features (Message Compressor, complete clone of the
Google's Pregel) and many improvements for computing system
performance and durability.

The artifacts are published and ready for you to download[1] either
from the Apache mirrors or from the Maven repository. For more
details, please take a look at our website[2] and wiki[3].

Many thanks to the Hama community for making this release possible.
