This month we have lots of news about ApacheCon North America; share some links to some of the conference keynotes; deliver a co-ordinated Apache Way track alongside our Community one; get some feedback from a first time ApacheCon attendee; encourage you to listen to ApacheCon via our FeatherCast podcast channel and we run yet another successful BarCampApache. ApacheCon NA 2017 After all the preparation ApacheCon North America took place this month in Miami. As well as the standard ApacheCon and Big Data tracks, several mini conferences were held around the main event. It also featured a new Apache Way track which is mentioned in separate section below in more detail. ApacheCon featured some great keynote speakers with some interesting topics from IoT to Digital Pychometrics.

For those sessions there were not on video, we have recorded the audio and these are available on FeatherCast. During ApacheCon Benjamin Young organised a ComDev Tools Hackathon where people interested in improving some of our tools got together and started working on it. Thanks very much to Benjamin for this initiative and to all the hackathon participants who came along to help out.

Miami was Stephen&#39;s his first ever ApacheCon and his blog post describes his experiences all the way through from apprehension to realisation. Stephen&#39;s full blog post can be found here. My First Experience of ApacheCon Blog Post by Stephen Downie OpenExpo in Madrid During May we promoted that we had been invited to have an Apache booth at the Open Expo in Madrid on 1st June. This is a new event for us and we wanted to find out whether it could be a good place to have an Apache presence at in the future. We understand that the conference had over 3000 visitors and 300 of them passed by our Apache booth not only to pick up stickers but to also find out more about the Foundation itself. Please take a look at our detailed blog post about the event. A big thank you to Ignasi Barrera, Jan Iversen and Sharan Foga who spent the day on booth duty during the event.

<h2>OpenExpo in Madrid</h2>
<p>During May we promoted that we had been invited to have an Apache booth at the Open Expo in Madrid on 1st June. This is a new event for us and we wanted to find out whether it could be a good place to have an Apache presence at in the future. We understand that the conference had over 3000 visitors and 300 of them passed by our Apache booth not only to pick up stickers but to also find out more about the Foundation itself. Please take a look at  <a href="https://s.apache.org/9uem" target="_blank">our detailed blog post about the event.</a> </p>
<p>A big thank you to Ignasi Barrera, Jan Iversen and Sharan Foga who spent the day on booth duty during the event. </p>
