The Apache log4net team is pleased to announce the release of Apache
log4net 1.2.11.  The release is available for download at

       <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download.html</a>

The Apache log4net library is a tool to help the programmer output log
statements to a variety of output targets.  log4net is a port of the
excellent Apache log4j framework to the Microsoft(R) .NET runtime.

log4net 1.2.11 is not only a bugfix release, it also adds support for
.NET 4.0 as well as the client profiles of .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0.
See the release-notes at

   <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/release-notes.html</a>

for a full list of changes.

Starting with this release log4net uses a new strong name key but we
also provide a binary distribution using the "old" strong name key of
log4net 1.2.10 and earlier. See the FAQ at

       <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#two-snks">http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#two-snks</a>

for details.

The binary distributions no longer contain assemblies built for the
Compact Framework 1.0 or the Shared Source CLI - you can build those
yourself using the source distribution.
