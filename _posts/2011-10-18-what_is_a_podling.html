  content: "All of this wasted time and effort because lawyers fill copyright licenses
    with myriad terms and conditions that no one can understand.  The real problem
    is these licenses.  Companies should not be able to write their own laws, because
    they try to write licenses that look like they grant rights, but in fact do not
    grant any rights at all.  Basically, I am saying that every copyright license
    I have ever seen is, at it's core, fraudulent on that basis.\r\n\r\nIt is simple.
    \ Unless copyright holders start acting like adults and respecting the rights
    of the public then copyright should be eliminated.  It serves no useful purpose
    anyway, except perhaps for the employment of lawyers."

    while we do stupid stuff like this."

    take that the wrong way:  I wish what's left of the OpenOffice.org project the
    best of luck and would love to see another strong, competitive open source and

    no point in OpenOffice.org coming out of the coma that Oracle put it in unless
    it eventually becomes more than just an inferior clone of LibreOffice.  "

  content: "@ Anon\r\n\"Meanwhile, the rest of the world that isn't using MS Office
    has moved on to LibreOffice\"\r\nI don't think so. There are to many new bugs
    and awful changes in LibreOffice. I think about Calc and Base especially. It is
    not possible to change from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice in a company.\r\n\r\nBut
    I see also a problem with ASF. They are Americans and Americans often do not understand
    what they do not like to understand. One thing they do not like to understand
    is that there are different cultures, cultures of working together. Call it \"The
    Apache Way\" or call it \"The American Way\", it isn't always the best choice.
    For the ASF it's an imperative.\r\n\r\nThe future will show if \"The Apache Way\"
    will work (American history says it didn't).\r\n\r\nAnon, you and a couple of
    friends aren't the rest of the world!"

<h1><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"></font></h1>
<hr />
<p>The Apache OpenOffice.org project is currently in the incubation phase. We're a 'podling'. It's where all new Apache projects begin, regardless of<br />
how mature your source code base is. In this post I'll attempt to explain a bit about incubation, and a bit about the 'Apache Way', and our current effort to meet the requirements for 3rd party code review and clearance. In future posts, I'll attempt to tackle other aspects of the project. If we all have a better understanding of how the work is becoming organized, those of you interested to volunteer will have a better idea of where to start, and those who are interested to follow our progress will have an easier way to check up on things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, a podling is not from<br />
'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' &ndash; a human being wrapped up to look<br />
like a large vegetable, or furry cute puppets from the Dark Crystal<br />
Cave of Jim Henson's imagination. It's the term we use here at<br />
Apache to describe the first phase of a prospective project; a podling is a<br />
project that is 'incubating'. Egg,<br />
podling, new thing with promise needing special care and attention. I<br />
think you get the idea.</p>
<p>It's that special care and attention<br />
part that is consuming the efforts of the PPMC or "Podling Project<br />
Management Committee" at the moment. If we are going to hatch, 'graduate' to a TLP or "Top Level Project" in Apache-speak, we are required to meet certain criteria evolved out of deep experience accumulated through Apache's 12 year history and its involvement with many other successful projects.</p>
<p>Apache defines a podling as &ldquo;A<br />
codebase and its community while in the process of being incubated.&rdquo;<br />
You can find the details on the complete <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html" title="Apache Incubation Policy">Apache Incubation Policy</a> here.</p>
<p>OK, so we have the code base, thanks to<br />
Oracle's decision, and we have a community signed in to the project<br />
already, 75 committers and growing. So where are we with the  process?</p>
<p>When do podlings hatch, and become<br />
Apache TLP or Top Level Projects?</p>
<p>The abbreviated answer requires the<br />
podling to:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver an official Apache release</li>
<li>Demonstrate you have successfully<br />
	created an open and diverse community</li>
<li>Follow the 'Apache Way' through<br />
	the process, documenting status, conducting ballots, maintaining a<br />
	fully open and transparent process, etc.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>OpenOffice is a very large chunk of<br />
code, many millions of lines of code. The PPMC has now successfully<br />
migrated all the source files into the Apache infrastructure nestled<br />
into its new nest within the Apache Subversion repository<br />
environment. We've run a build test on Linux and we know we've got<br />
the code we need to begin to build a release.</p></p>
<p>But wait, before we can meet the requirement of producing an official release, Apache requires that we conduct a thorough&nbsp;<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/index.html" title="IP or Intellectual Property review and clearance process.">IP or Intellectual Property review and clearance process</a>. This means that the resulting Apache<br />
release may be licensed under the Apache License 2. It requires<br />
that all...</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; " class="webkit-indent-blockquote">
<p>&ldquo;incoming code<br />
is fully signed off before any release. This simply reinforces the<br />
Apache requirements: all code must have appropriate licenses....The<br />
process of preparing an <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#rules" title="Apache release">Apache release</a> should include an audit of the code to<br />
ensure that all files have appropriate headers and that all<br />
dependencies complies with Apache policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the resulting Apache<br />
OpenOffice release(s) will provide the maximum opportunity for the<br />
development of a broader spectrum of OpenOffice derivatives than we<br />
see today. The OpenOffice of the past, will look very different in<br />
the future as more developers become familiar with the code, and see<br />
new opportunities not previously available.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, verdana, 'Bitstream Vera Sans', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; "> </span></p>
<p>Right now, our<br />
immediate task is to resolve the licensing incompatibilities for 3<sup>rd</sup><br />
party code modules used by OpenOffice. Since Oracle did not possess<br />
the copyright for these modules, they were not included in the original Oracle Software Grant Agreement, and therefore we are working to either<br />
deprecate, or find a replacement that may be used either as a binary<br />
file or an alternative source file that fills the function needed.<br />
We're confident that the process will be concluded in the next weeks,<br />
but it is detail-oriented work, and must be done thoroughly and<br />
correctly in order to clear the path for an official podling release<br />
of Apache OpenOffice.</p>
<p>Before we can produce an Apache release, we must complete the code clearance step, ensuring that the license headers include License and Notification files for all<br />
artifacts in the build be done to the satisfaction of the PPMC<br />
and the Incubator PMC which governs the Apache OpenOffice podling. This will clear the way forward to develop a realistic target date for issuing our first 'Apache OpenOffice.org' release&nbsp;</p>
<p>In future posts, I'll sketch out<br />
how the project is being organized, mapping out the areas that offer<br />
interesting and exciting opportunities needing new volunteers to step<br />
up and take on. &nbsp;</p>
