<p>The Apache OpenWebBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache Meecrowave 1.0.0</p>
<p>Apache Meecrowave is a small server based on </p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Tomcat (Servlets)</li>
<li>Apache OpenWebBeans (CDI)</li>
<li>Apache Johnzon (JSON-P and JSON-B), and</li>
<li>Apache CXF (JAX-RS).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That means it is ideally suited for Microservices and standalone applications. </p>
<p>Meecrowave can be either started via a maven plugin (for ease of development), programmatically as embedded server, bundled as application with your business code or as runner to start up portable WAR or JAR applications. </p>

<p>Hashes can be found here<br />

<p>The binary artifacts are available on maven.central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/meecrowave/</p>
