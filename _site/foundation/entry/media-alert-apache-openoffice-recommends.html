<meta name="description" content="Wilmington, DE &mdash;4 May 2021&mdash;&nbsp; Who: Apache OpenOffice, an Open Source office-document productivity suite comprising six productivity applications: Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, and Base. The OpenOffice suite is based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF), supports 41 languages, and ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, and Linux 32-bit. Apache OpenOffice delivers up to 2.4 Million downloads each month. What: A recently reported vulnerability states that all versions of OpenOffice through 4.1.9 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks, and could lead to untrusted code execution.&nbsp;The Apache OpenOffice Project has filed a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures report with MITRE Corporation&rsquo;s national vulnerability reporting system: &gt; CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks&gt;&gt; Severity: moderate&gt;&gt;Credit: Fabian Br&auml;unlein and Lukas Euler of Positive Security https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce#open-libreoffice The complete CVE report is available at https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2021-30245.html How: Applications of the OpenOffice suite handle non-http(s) hyperlinks in an insecure way, allowing for 1-click code execution on Windows and Xubuntu systems via malicious executable files hosted on Internet-accessible file shares. Why: The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10 assures that a security warning is displayed to give users the option of continuing to open the hyperlink. Best practice dictates to be careful when opening documents from unknown and unverified sources.&nbsp; When: The vulnerability predates OpenOffice entering the Apache Incubator. During the analysis of this issue, it was discovered that an incorrect bug fix was made by the StarOffice/OpenOffice.org developers preparing OpenOffice 2.0 in 2005, whilst under the auspices of Sun Microsystems.&nbsp; Where: Download Apache OpenOffice v4.1.10 at https://www.openoffice.org/download/ Apache OpenOffice Highlights 24 October 2020 &mdash; 300 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice14 October 2020 &mdash; 20 year anniversary of OpenOffice18 October 2016 &mdash; 200 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice17 April 2014 &mdash; 100 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice17 October 2012 &mdash; OpenOffice graduated as an Apache Top Level Project (TLP)13 June 2011 &mdash; OpenOffice.org entered the Apache Incubator [downloads are binary installation files] For more information, visit https://openoffice.apache.org/ and https://twitter.com/ApacheOO About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)Established in 1999, The Apache Software Foundation is the world&rsquo;s largest Open Source foundation, stewarding 227M+ lines of code and providing more than $20B+ worth of software to the public at 100% no cost.
