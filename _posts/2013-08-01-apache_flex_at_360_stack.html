<p>Come see us at <a href="http://www.360stack.com/">360|Stack</a> in Denver, Aug 4-8.  Several Apache Flex committers will be<br />
there and you can find us hanging out between sessions in the Apache Flex Discovery<br />
Room which will be in the Englewood room at the conference hotel.  There will be<br />
munchies until we run out.</p>
<p>There are still a few tickets left if you can get over to Denver and learn about the latest on<br />
Flex, including a prototype of Flex running in a browser without Flash.  The organizer was<br />
even kind enough to come up with a special discount code to use when your register to<br />
save 20%.  Just use "AlexRocks" when registering.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
