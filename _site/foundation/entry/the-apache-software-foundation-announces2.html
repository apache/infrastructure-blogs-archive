<meta name="description" content="Rebranded Open Source Composite Oriented Programming platform reflects growing codebase and community. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;11 January 2017&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Zest&trade;, the Composite Oriented Programming platform, has been renamed Apache Polygene. Apache Polygene is a platform to develop applications with large domain models and complex business logic for Java enterprise developers. Apache Polygene introduces multi-inheritence, aspect orientation (both typesafe and generic weaving) and persistence to both SQL and NoSQL storage systems. Apache Polygene also easily integrates with other technologies such as Spring Framework, REST, OSGi and many more. &quot;The name change was triggered to prevent confusion with other similarly named software such as the visualization toolkit from Eclipse,&quot; said Niclas Hedhman, Vice President of Apache Polygene. &quot;Since becoming an official ASF project, our codebase and community continue to flourish. We are confident that our new identity will reflect ongoing innovation and increased productivity.&quot; The resolution relating to the project&#39;s name change was approved at the ASF Board meeting in December 2016. Project History In 2007, Hedhman convinced Rickard &Ouml;berg to create an Open Source project based on &Ouml;berg&rsquo;s Composite Oriented Programming (COP) concept, which launched as Qi4j. Since then, 28 people have contributed source to the project, with many others participating on mailing lists regarding direction, concepts and design. In 2015 the project arrived at the ASF as Apache Zest, along the unique designation as the first project to enter the ASF as al Top-Level Project&ndash; without entering the Apache Incubator (the official entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the ASF&rsquo;s efforts). As part of its eligibility, the project had to meet the rigorous requirements of the Apache Maturity Model http://s.apache.org/O4p , that addresses the integrity of a project&#39;s code, copyright, licenses, releases, community, consensus building, and independence, among other qualities. In March 2015 Apache Zest became an official ASF Top-Level Project, and renamed as Apache Polygene in December 2016. Availability and Oversight Apache Polygene software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&#39;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.
