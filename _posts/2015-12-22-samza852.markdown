<p>I am very excited to announce that the much awaited <a href="http://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a> 0.10.10 has been released. This is our third release as an Apache Top-level Project. Samza is a distributed stream processing framework that uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. The project graduated from Apache Incubator early this year in January. It was originally created at LinkedIn and still continues to be used in production. The project is currently under active development with contributions from a diverse group of contributors and commiters. Since the last release in July 2015, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of Samza in the industry (e.g. Samza is in production in Uber and Netflix. see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMZA/Powered+By">PoweredBy</a>).</p>

<p>A source download of the 0.10.0 release is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/samza/0.10.0">here</a>. The release JARs are also available in <a href="https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/samza/">Apache's Maven repository</a>. See Samza's <a href="http://samza.apache.org/startup/download/">download</a> page for details.</p>
