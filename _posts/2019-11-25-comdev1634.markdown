The Lecture Series about Open Source is an initiative of School of Software, Tsinghua University contributing to open source innovation and implement the national innovation development strategy and big data action plan in the new digital economy era.<br /><br /> Wang Jianmin, Dean, Professor of School of software, Tsinghua University, Apache IoTDB PPMC, in his opening speech, <em><strong>stressed the importance of open source as a major enabling environment of collaborative innovation in software engineering</strong></em>.&nbsp; Embracing open source will have great impact under the current circumstance to the national information technology development and international collaborations among big data software experts. Tsinghua University school of software, is currently in a process of reformation and encourage students to acquire system building skills by joining and contributing to top-tier open source projects. <br /><br />Craig L. Russell, Chairman of the Apache Open Source Foundation, elaborated on the Apache way of organizing open source community in his presentation, including the history of Apache, how Apache works, why the ASF works, and the process from the incubator to graduation for an Apache project. This is the second time Craig presenting the Apache principles such as “community over code” in Tsinghua, by then, he was on the post of Apache secretary. </p>

Around 150 students and faculties from Tsinghua University, Beijing University of Posts and telecommunications, and other universities attended the activity. <br /><br /><strong><em>&quot;I wish you all the best as you learnt how to do software, and it is just important to learn how to develop software in the community. Apache is a great place to find the community that you can love. So, come with us.</em></strong>&quot; Craig said.</p>
