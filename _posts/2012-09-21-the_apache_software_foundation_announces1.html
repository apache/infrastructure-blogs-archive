<p><i><b>Developer-focused<br />
 Community Edition explores key Open Source applications and issues,<br />
from Big Data and Smart Search to Cloud and Infrastructure. </b></i></p>
<p>Forest<br />
 Hill, MD &ndash;21 September 2012&ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the<br />
all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open<br />
Source projects and initiatives, today announced the program for<br />
ApacheCon, its official conference.</p>
<p>Apache products power<br />
half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of operations, billions<br />
of objects, and enhance the lives of countless users and developers.<br />
ApacheCon brings developers and users together to explore key issues in<br />
building Open Source solutions "The Apache Way".</p>
<p>ApacheCon<br />
returns to Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in<br />
Sinsheim, Germany, attracting Open Source users, developers,<br />
gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts to the newly-introduced<br />
"Community Edition" of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at<br />
 a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring an array of<br />
sessions focused on Apache projects and initiatives, plus MeetUps,<br />
FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. This is an<br />
ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based<br />
solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache<br />
project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open<br />
Source products and community practices.</p>
<p>ApacheCon Europe<br />
Community Edition is organized and run by the Apache community with<br />
assistance from The Open Bastion, producers of ApacheCon North America<br />
2013. In keeping with the community-driven culture of the ASF, all<br />
