<i><b>Premier Open Source event brings developers and users together to lead communities &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, and accelerate success in evaluating, building, adopting, and deploying solutions across the Apache ecosystem.<br /></b></i><br />Forest Hill, MD –30 October 2012– The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) today announced key milestones and updates for ApacheCon, its official conference series.<br /><br />Now in its 13th year, ApacheCon brings users, developers, gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts together to explore key issues in evaluating, building, and adopting Open Source innovations &quot;The Apache Way&quot;. ApacheCon is an ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open Source products and community practices. In alignment with the community-driven culture of the ASF, all content for ApacheCon is selected by members of Apache Project Management Committees.<br /><br />More than 500 delegates will convene at ApacheCon Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany. The sold-out event marks the introduction of the &quot;Community Edition&quot; of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring nearly 140 presentations across 6 tracks, MeetUps, FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. The complete schedule is available at <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu/schedule/">http://www.apachecon.eu/schedule/</a><br /><br />ApacheCon Europe is underwritten through a generous donation by Platinum Sponsor SAP; Claus von Riegen, Head of Open Source and Open Standards participation, will serve as the conference’s opening plenary speaker.
