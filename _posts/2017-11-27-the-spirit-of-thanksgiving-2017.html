<h3>﻿ Contribution</h3>
<p>The conference is concluded, but our journey has just begun. As the conference organizer, we, KAIYUANSHE's directors of the board, were worried about whether the main themes of the conference , i.e. the journey to the successful community management and project contribution, could attract the domestic technology-oriented audience. However, the feedbacks we gathered from the conference audience have been quite encouraging. Echoing perfectly the "communities over code" motto advocated by the world leading communities, like ASF, our key themes "China community, global contribution" has been highly recognized by many guru lecturers and picky audience of this conference. This is not only the biggest encouragement to our perseverance in our missions of promoting open source governance, community collaboration and international bridging, but also allows us to continue to move forward with many partners' support.</p>
