<p>The ApacheCon Europe Planning team today announced the program, speaker lineup, and sponsors for 
ApacheCon, the official conference of The Apache Software Foundation.<br /><br />ApacheCon 
returns to Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in 
Sinsheim, Germany, attracting Open Source users, developers, 
gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts to the newly-introduced 
&quot;Community Edition&quot; of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at
 a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring an array of 
sessions focused on Apache projects and initiatives, plus MeetUps, 
FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. This is an 
ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based 
solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache 
project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open 
Source products and community practices.<br /><br />ApacheCon Europe 
Community Edition is organized and run by the Apache community; all 
content for ApacheCon has been selected by Apache Project Management 
Committees. 13 tracks explore key Open Source applications and issues, from Big Data and Smart Search to Cloud and Infrastructure, and include:<br /><br /><b>Apache
