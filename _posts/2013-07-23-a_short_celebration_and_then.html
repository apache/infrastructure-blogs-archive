  content: 'I use OO since version 1.0, very appreciated of the effort of team. The
    version 3.4.1 is the best without any annoying. Anyway the display or recent file
    in Thai Language is not good so I waiting for version 4 for years. Now it is released,
    congratulation to the team and would like to express thanks that you made the
    small enterprises survive without paying bigh amount of money for the other Office
    suite. I always appreciated OpenOffice. '

  content: "Thanks so much!  I've been using OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Kingsoft Office,
    and Google Docs for a while now, but I keep OpenOffice as my main suite because
    it's more stable than LibreOffice.  As a computer technician I recommend it to
    all my clients over purchasing Microsoft Office, which I am proud to say I've
    never purchased.  I have been waiting for OpenOffice to offer better support for
    opening DOCX files, though, especially tables and clip art from Microsoft, so
    I'm excited to see what version 4 has to offer.  Thanks!\r\nEzra\r\n"

  content: "Thanks for this update. I found the installation to be smooth and look
    forward to the enhancements. \r\n\r\nI've tried switching over to Libre Office
    a few times, mainly because the cool kids thing it is neat, for some reason. I've
    always found bugs (and reported them) to Libre Office, bugs which were dealbreakers.
    I've found bugs in Open Office as well, but there were reasonable workarounds
    while the code was being fixed, or simply was fixed in an update already.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for being there for us Open Office, and for the ongoing improvements. "

  content: Thanks for the SUPER work on OpenOffice!  This suite has allowed me to
    develop an application for record keeping and reporting for a children's charity
    medical clinic at no cost to the clinic.

  content: "A a long time user of Openoffice, I was pleasantly surprised by the upgrades
    in version 4. Great Job!\r\nNow you only need to emulate Adobe Indesign's shadow
    effects with improved gaussian blur. \r\n\r\nJust a small issue though. I noticed
    a huge memory leak in Draw after using it for log stretches even without hi res
    images?\r\n\r\nStill a welcome improvement."

<p>Cheers to the community on the successful release of Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp; Full details of release can be found in our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.0+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp; You can download Apache OpenOffice 4.0 <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This was a major release and a major effort for the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Directory+of+Volunteers">many volunteers</a> who worked on coding, testing, translation, support, marketing, documentation and other aspects of the project.&nbsp; And thanks are due to ongoing support from other parts of the Apache Software Foundation, especially the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html">Apache Infrastructure Team</a> for their outsized effort to support our outsized project.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is summertime, at least for volunteers in the northern hemisphere,&nbsp; and August is vacation time.&nbsp; Many of us will be taking a break and enjoying time with friends and family.&nbsp; But then we'll be back and working at full force, with a focus on: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing additional language translations to AOO 4.0.&nbsp; There are quite a few languages that are "almost done", but did not make it into this release.&nbsp; But rather than wait until 4.1 we'll release these languages, in batches, as they become available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tentatively we're aiming for mid-September for the first batch.&nbsp; If you want to help with a particular translation, we'd <a href="mailto:L10N@openoffice.apache.org">love to hear from you</a>.</li>
<li>Apache OpenOffice 4.1.&nbsp; We've jotted down some <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Planning">proposed ideas</a> on our wiki.&nbsp; We now need to turn that into a plan, ideally for a 4.1 release at the end of 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as we transition from one major release to another, this is a great time for new volunteers in all areas to join the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested helping us make the next great version of OpenOffice, then<br />
we want to hear from you.&nbsp; We're not only programmers, but are a<br />
community of testers, UI designers, web designers, technical writers,<br />
accessibility experts, translators, social media experts, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Volunteers in all areas are welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; More information can be found on<br />
our <a rel="nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">Get Involved</a> page.</p>
