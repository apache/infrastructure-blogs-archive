<div>
<div>
<div>The ReviewBoard vm ran out of space and despite our best<br />
efforts to fix the space issue without restarting the service, that is<br />
the only option left.</p>
</div>
<p>The plan is to restart the vm on<br />
Thursday August 20th at 21:00 UTC (14:00 PDT), but if it fills up again<br />
before then, the resize will take place earlier.</p></div>
<p>A tweet via @infrabot will be tweeted 1 hour before the scheduled downtime and a planned maintenance notice will be posted to <a href="http://status.apache.org" target="_blank">status.apache.org</a>.</p></div>
<p>The actual downtime should take no more than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The next email about this will be after the service has resumed from the <span>planned</span> downtime.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Geoff Corey</p>
