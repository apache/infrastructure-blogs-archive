<p><b><i>Stable version of Open Source, distributed Big Data store for Apache Hadoop features improved performance, ease of use, new availability guarantees, and future release compatibility.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;24 February 2015&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache&trade; HBase&trade; v1.0, the distributed, scalable, database for Apache&trade; Hadoop&trade; and HDFS&trade;.</p>
<p>"Apache HBase v1.0 marks a major milestone in the project's development," said Michael Stack, Vice President of Apache HBase. "It is a monumental moment that the army of contributors who have made this possible should all be proud of. The result is a thing of collaborative beauty that also happens to power key, large-scale Internet platforms."</p>
<p>Dubbed the "Hadoop Database", HBase is used on top of Apache Hadoop and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for random, real-time read/write access for Big Data (billions of rows X millions of columns) across clusters of commodity hardware. HBase is used by Apple, Facebook, FINRA, Flipboard, Flurry, Pinterest, RocketFuel, Salesforce, Xiaomi, and Yahoo!, among many other organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apache HBase has also fostered a healthy ecosystem of projects that run on top of it, such as Apache Phoenix, a SQL layer over HBase, and OpenTSDB, a time series database that uses HBase as its backing store.</p>
<p>"Medium- and high- scale services at hundreds of enterprises and some of the largest Internet companies today are backed by Apache HBase," explained Andrew Purtell, member of the Apache HBase Project Management Committee. "Chances are when using your computer or mobile device you interact with a system built with HBase many times daily without ever knowing it. The HBase 1.0 release appropriately acknowledges a maturity already achieved by the Apache HBase community and software both, and is a great occasion to learn more about HBase, how it can help you solve your scale data challenges, and the growing ecosystem of Open Source and commercial software that chooses HBase as foundation."</p>
<p>Apache HBase v1.0 is the result of 7 years of development, and reflects more than 1,500 changes and upgrades over the previous major release, Apache HBase 0.98.0. Notable new features include:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance without sacrificing stability;</li>
<li>Introduction of new APIs and reorganization of select client-side APIs;</li>
<li>Read availability using timeline consistent region replicas for new availability guarantees;</li>
<li>Online configuration change to enable reloading a subset of the server configuration without restarting the region servers; and</li>
<li>New look, enhanced usability, and radically revamped documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please see the accompanying technical fact sheet at <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/hbase/entry/start_of_a_new_era">https://blogs.apache.org/hbase/entry/start_of_a_new_era</a> for details on new functionality).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lars Hofhansl, Principal Architect at Salesforce.com, and member of the HBase Project Management Committee, said, "Over 13,000 JIRA issues were filed to get HBase where it is now. Going forward we have a clear compatibility story between major and minor versions."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p /></p>
<p>"This is a very exciting moment for Apache HBase, and<br />
goes to show how far we have come as a community in stabilizing and maturing<br />
Apache HBase", said Francis Liu, Development Lead for Apache HBase at<br />
Yahoo. "HBase is an integral part of our technology stack powering<br />
numerous critical offstage processing use cases across our business in online<br />
advertising, search, communication, content personalization and targeting, and<br />
social, mobile and emerging products. Today, we operate some of the largest<br />
HBase clusters across a 3,000 server footprint, and look forward to working<br />
with the community with a stable release as a base to scale individual HBase<br />
clusters to millions of regions soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hearty congratulations to the HBase community," said Ishan Chhabra, Lead of all things HBase at Rocketfuel Inc. "Apache HBase already powers our critical online applications and data pipelines over thousands of machines globally, and the community's relentless focus on stability and performance gives us the confidence to continue making it an integral part of our data stack as we scale to 10,000+ machines."</p>
<p>"Apache HBase is a critical data storage system at Pinterest, where we run it across thousands of nodes doing close to 10 million operations every second," said Raghavendra Prabhu, Head of Infrastructure at Pinterest. "HBase is the underlying technology behind Pinterest's Zen graph storage service, which powers key product features like the home feed, messages, notifications, network news and our interest graph. We are eagerly looking forward to the improvements in availability and reliability in HBase 1.0 and will continue to work with the community on improving it for large scale user facing workloads."</p>
<p>"HBase has been the cornerstone of our customer analytics platform Lily since late 2008", says Steven Noels, CTO of NGDATA. "Granted it was an adventurous choice at that time, but since then HBase has evolved and matured, reconfirming that choice time and time again. Seeing 1.0 (finally) shipping is a sign of confirmed adoption throughout all layers of the industry, from internet companies up to (in our case) large financial institutions, telcos and media companies. We are thankful to be part of such a strong, persistent and vibrant community development endeavour."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"HBase-1.0.0 is the start of a new era," said Enis S&ouml;ztutar, HBase v1.0 release manager and member of the Apache HBase Project Management Committee. "We have marked it as the next stable version of Apache HBase, and encourage all new users to start using this version."</p>
<p>"There is no rest for the wickedly talented set of contributors who made HBase 1.0," added Stack. "HBase 2.0 is already taking form in our master branch. Users can look forward to new orders of read/write and node count scaling and this time around they won't have to wait seven years on it shipping; HBase 2.0 will be out later this year."</p>
<p><b>Availability and Oversight<br /></b>Apache HBase v1.0 is available immediately as a free download from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hbase/ As with all Apache products, Apache HBase software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.
