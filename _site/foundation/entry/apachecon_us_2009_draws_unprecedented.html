    <p><b><i>California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oakland Mayor Ron<br />
Dellums recognize The Apache Software Foundation for a decade of open<br />
source leadership and technology innovation</i></b></p>
<p>FOREST<br />
HILL, Md., Nov. 11 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Closing out the<br />
celebrations for its 10th anniversary, The Apache Software Foundation<br />
(ASF) today announced highlights from ApacheCon US 2009, which took<br />
place November 2-6, 2009 in Oakland, Calif. The Foundation received<br />
unprecedented support and recognition as testament to the growing<br />
strength and influence of the global Apache community. During the week,<br />
The ASF was honored by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and by<br />
Oakland City Mayor Ron Dellums for the key technologies developed,<br />
overseen, and shepherded by the all-volunteer organization over the<br />
last decade. November 4 has been designated Apache Software Foundation<br />
Day.</p>
<p>ApacheCon<br />
is the official user conference for The ASF. The event attracted more<br />
than 600 attendees from the global Apache community, and featured the<br />
most extensive conference program to date with more than 100 hours of<br />
trainings, over 90 sessions, 25 BarCampApache discussion groups, 11<br />
project MeetUps, two days of code collaboration at the Hackathon, and<br />
numerous entertaining Lightning Talks. Dozens of corporate sponsors,<br />
exhibitors, and community and media partners helped make this year's<br />
ApacheCon among the most popular events to date.</p>
<p>Conference highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thought-provoking<br />
keynotes, including the Apache Pioneers Panel reuniting ASF founding<br />
members and early contributors; Brian Behlendorf on how the Open Source<br />
movement has positively impacted social change; and Kirrily Robert on<br />
the role of women in Open Source.</li>
<li>Subversion, the award-winning<br />
Open Source version control and software configuration management tool,<br />
formally submitted itself to the Apache Incubator with the aim of<br />
becoming an ASF Top-Level Project.</li>
<li>Several Apache projects also<br />
celebrated their 10th anniversary, including Apache XML, Apache<br />
Jakarta, Apache Cocoon, Apache Xerces, Apache Ant, and Apache Tomcat,<br />
who debuted Tomcat 7.0 during the conference.</li>
<li>The Apache<br />
Directory project announced a newly-formed alliance between the<br />
OpenLDAP Foundation and the ASF, created to drive various industry<br />
standards. The Project also released version 1.5 of its Apache<br />
Directory Studio product during the event.</li>
<li>ASF Platinum Sponsor<br />
Microsoft announced that they will be renewing their sponsorship for<br />
the upcoming year, bolstering both their involvement in the ASF as well<br />
as with numerous Apache projects.</li>
<li>An unprecedented number of<br />
MeetUps were held throughout the week drawing attendees en masse to<br />
participate in discussions on popular Open Source projects such as<br />
NoSQL, Apache Tomcat, Apache Hadoop, Apache Maven, OSGi, and Subversion.</li>
<li>The<br />
ASF's 10th Anniversary was cited by numerous publications, members of<br />
the Open Source community, industry foundations, corporate users, and<br />
individuals.</li>
<li>The ASF's Big Feather Birthday Bash was followed<br />
by a rave-style afterparty that kicked off with music DJ'ed by "Vitamin<br />
B" -- a.k.a. ASF co-founder Brian Behlendorf.</li>
</ul>
