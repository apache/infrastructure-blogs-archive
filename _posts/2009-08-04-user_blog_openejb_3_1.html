<p>Nick Mpallas writes in his Nick Says blog an entry titled <a href="http://nickermansays.blogspot.com/2009/07/openejb-31-jboss-embedded-and-ejb-30.html">OpenEJB 3.1 JBoss Embedded and EJB 3.0 unit testing</a> about his month long quest to figure out a way to unit test EJBs.  He tries JBoss Embedded first as so many people do and eventually settles on OpenEJB with TestNG and Hibernate.</p>
<p>Thanks for writing, Nick!  We're really excited to see more updates about your progress.</p>
