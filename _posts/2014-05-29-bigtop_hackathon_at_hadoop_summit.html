<p>Time for another hackathon.</p>
<p>There are alot of companies who contribute to BigTop. &nbsp;Pivotal, Cloudera, Red Hat, WanDisco, Amazon and so on... if I left yours out feel free to leave a comment below and I'll update this post. &nbsp;And today, <b>we&nbsp;are proud&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;to announce that <b>Red Hat</b> is hosting the next bigtop hackathon, immediately following Hadoop Summit 2014, in San Jose. &nbsp;Hadoop is about alot more than just soucre code - its about packaging, deployment, configuration, and so on. &nbsp;And&nbsp;<b>BigTop </b>has embraced the difficult task of tying all this together.</p>
<p><u><font size="2"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Apache BigTop makes Hadoop deployment transparent</span></font></u></p>
<p>All source code is complex, regardless of the language. &nbsp;But whats even more complex is the deployment of code on a distributed system. &nbsp;While vendors have come a long way making it easy to DEPLOY hadoop with black box administrative or cloud tools, nobody has really <i>opened up </i>hadoop by <i>building a culture around the deployment of it.  </i></p>
<p>Enter Apache BigTop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BigTop contains all the stuff thats not in the hadoop docs. &nbsp;For example:</p></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Puppet modules</i>&nbsp;for installation and configuration of hadoop without using a tarball.</li>
<li><i>Vagrant recipes</i> for deployment-from-zero.</li>
<li><i>Smoke tests </i>for fine grained testing.</li>
<li>The intersection of Java and RPM .</li>
<li><i>bigpetstore app</i> for demonstrating to the business community how to actually use hadoop, gradle, pig, and google's javascript visualization widgets tools to build, test, and deploy a reference "hadoop app".</li>
</ul>
<h3><u><font size="2"><span style="font-weight: normal;">BigTop is working to embrace HCFS</span></font></u></h3>
<p>The community has put alot of work into testing different hadoop stacks on different file systems (<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HCFS/Progress" title="HCFS">https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HCFS/Progress</a>), and the bigtop community has embraced this effort - to their own higher cost of having to support a generic filesystem deployment, and also, at the cost of alot of JIRA reviewing. &nbsp;For example, with the recent BIGTOP-952 and BIGTOP-1200 JIRAs, we're now packaging HDFS independent artifacts into BigTop. &nbsp;That paves the way for more competition, more choice, and more hadoop hacking - which ultimately translates to a better end-user experiences, around hadoop.</p>
<h3 style="letter-spacing: normal;"><u><font size="2"><span style="font-weight: normal;">BigTop builds OS+Admin freindly packages for emerging ecosystem projects, </span>fast<span style="font-weight: normal;"> !</span></font></u></h3>
<p>If you compare apache bigtop with other hadoop vendor distributions, you'll find that it is the bleeding edge. &nbsp;For example, you can watch this recent video demonstration of spinning up Storm on BigTop, from ApacheCon 2014:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZzJxsMJahc" title="BigTop Crash Course">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZzJxsMJahc</a>, to see just how easy it is to deploy spark out of the box using BigTop's deployment recipes. &nbsp;As new projects come forward in the upstream, the first place to put them is into apache BigTop. &nbsp;This means that if you want to <b>try out</b>&nbsp;a new animal in hadoop's stack, you can easily do so with the bigtop stack. &nbsp;And again : the infrastructure around vagrant makes it easy to build maintainable VM workflows around hadoop app and distribution development tasks, which easily be modified to include/exlude whichever bleeding edge packages.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think of bigtop's approach to packaging and deployment as a lower-level version of apache ambari.</p>
<p>Sounds Interesting? come to the hackathon in Mountain View after Hadoop Summit &nbsp;!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this is all prelude to the BigTop hackathon that we are hosting at &nbsp;Red Hat. &nbsp;The focus will be on hacking - not presentations. &nbsp;But that doesn't mean you have to be an expert to get involved. &nbsp;Coming to this hackathon will give you a chance to pair program with the BigTop commiters, and try your hand at a working directly on a JIRA. &nbsp;I think most would agree that <i>hacking around on&nbsp;apache bigtop is an excellent introduction to that hadoop ecosystem. &nbsp;</i></p>
<p><font size="2">The NEXT HACKATHON will be from June 6th - JUNE 9th at the Red Hat Offices in Mountain View California. &nbsp;For more details, ping us on the BigTop mailing list and check the meetup URL :&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Bigtop-Meetup/events/184893732/" title="BigTop Meetup June 6+9">http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Bigtop-Meetup/events/184893732/</a>&nbsp;.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p>See you there !&nbsp;</p></p>
