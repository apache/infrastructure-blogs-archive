<p>
We are proud to announce the release of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads">Apache Kafka&reg; 3.3</a> on behalf of the Apache Kafka community. The 3.3 release contains many new features and improvements. This blog post will highlight some of the more prominent features. For a full list of changes, be sure to check the <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/3.3.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html">3.3.0</a> and <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/3.3.1/RELEASE_NOTES.html">3.3.1</a> release notes.</p>
<p>
For several years, the Apache Kafka community has been developing a new way to run Apache Kafka with self-managed metadata. This new mode, called KRaft mode, improves partition scalability and resiliency while simplifying deployments of Apache Kafka. It also eliminates the need to run an Apache ZooKeeper&trade;  cluster alongside every Apache Kafka cluster.</p>
<p>
The 3.3 release now marks KRaft mode as production ready for new clusters only. There are some features that are currently supported by Apache ZooKeeper (ZK) mode that are not yet supported by KRaft mode. For more information on these features and proposed KRaft timelines, read <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-833%3A+Mark+KRaft+as+Production+Ready">KIP-833</a>.</p>
<h2>Kafka Broker, Controller, Producer, Consumer and Admin Client</h2>
<h3>KIP-833: Mark KRaft as Production Ready</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-833%3A+Mark+KRaft+as+Production+Ready">KIP-833</a> marks KRaft as production-ready for new clusters in the Apache Kafka 3.3 release. KIP-833 also marks 3.5.0 as the bridge release. The bridge release is the release that would allow the migration of Apache Kafka clusters from ZK mode to KRaft mode.</p>
<h3>KIP-778: KRaft to KRaft upgrades</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-778%3A+KRaft+Upgrades">KIP-778</a> allows the upgrade of KRaft clusters without the need for the infamous &ldquo;double roll&rdquo;. In order to facilitate upgrades of Apache Kafka in KRaft mode, we need the ability to upgrade controllers and brokers while holding back the use of new RPCs and record formats until the whole cluster has been upgraded.</p>
<h3>KIP-841: Fenced replicas should not be allowed to join the ISR in KRaft</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-841%3A+Fenced+replicas+should+not+be+allowed+to+join+the+ISR+in+KRaft">KIP-841</a> improves the topic partitions&rsquo; availability during clean shutdown. It does this by enforcing the following invariants: 1) a fenced or in-controlled-shutdown replica is not eligible to be in the ISR; and 2) a fenced or in-controlled-shutdown replica is not eligible to become leader.</p>
<h3>KIP-836: Expose replication information of the cluster metadata</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-836%3A+Addition+of+Information+in+DescribeQuorumResponse+about+Voter+Lag">KIP-836</a> exposes the DescribeQuorum API to the Admin client and adds two new fields per replica to the response. This information can be used to query the availability and lag of the cluster metadata for the controllers and brokers in a KRaft cluster.</p>
<h3>KIP-835: Monitor KRaft Controller Quorum health</h3>
<p>
With KRaft mode, Apache Kafka added a new controller quorum to the cluster. These controllers need to be able to commit records for Apache Kafka to be available. <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-835%3A+Monitor+KRaft+Controller+Quorum+Health">KIP-835</a> measures availability by periodically causing the high-watermark and the last committed offset to increase. Monitoring services can compare that these last committed offsets are advancing. They can also use these metrics to check that all of the brokers and controllers are relatively within each other's offset.</p>
<h3>KIP-859: Add metadata log processing error related metrics</h3>
<p>
With KRaft mode, the cluster metadata replicated log is the source of metadata related information for all servers in the cluster. Any errors that occur while processing this log could lead to the in-memory state for the server becoming inconsistent. It is important that such errors are made visible. <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-859%3A+Add+Metadata+Log+Processing+Error+Related+Metrics">KIP-859</a> exposes metrics that can be monitored so that affected servers can be discovered.</p>
<h3>KIP-794: Strictly Uniform Sticky Partitioner</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-794%3A+Strictly+Uniform+Sticky+Partitioner">KIP-794</a> improves the default partitioner to distribute non-keyed data evenly in batches among healthy brokers and less data to unhealthy brokers. For example, the p99 latency for a producer workload with abnormal behavior was reduced from 11s to 154ms.</p>
<h3>KIP-373: Allow users to create delegation tokens for other users</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-373%3A+Allow+users+to+create+delegation+tokens+for+other+users">KIP-373</a> allows users to create delegation tokens for other users. This allows the following use cases: 1) a designated superuser can create tokens without requiring individual user credentials; and 2) a designated superuser can run kafka clients on behalf of another user.</p>
<h3>KIP-831: Add metric for log recovery progress</h3>
<p>
Log recovery is a process triggered when a Kafka server starts up, if it had a previous unclean shutdown. It is used to make sure the log is in a good state and is not corrupted. <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-831%3A+Add+metric+for+log+recovery+progress">KIP-831</a> exposes metrics to allow users to monitor the progress of log recovery.</p>
<h3>KIP-709: Extend OffsetFetch RPC to accept multiple group ids</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=173084258">KIP-709</a> streamlines the process of fetching offsets from consumer groups so that a single request can be made to fetch offsets for multiple groups. This carries the following advantages: 1) it reduces request overhead; and 2) it simplifies client side code.</p>
<h3>KIP-827: Expose log dirs total and usable space via Kafka API</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-827%3A+Expose+logdirs+total+and+usable+space+via+Kafka+API">KIP-827</a> exposes an RPC for querying the disk total size and disk usage size per log directory. This is useful for tools that are interested in querying this information without relying on the exposed metrics.</p>
<h3>KIP-851: Add requireStable flag into ListConsumerGroupOffsetsOptions</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-851%3A+Add+requireStable+flag+into+ListConsumerGroupOffsetsOptions">KIP-851</a> adds the option in the Admin client for querying the committed offsets when using exactly once semantics.</p>
<h3>KIP-843: Adding addMetricIfAbsent method to Metrics</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-843%3A+Adding+addMetricIfAbsent+method+to+Metrics">KIP-843</a> allows the metrics API to atomically query a metric if present or create a metric if absent.</p>
<h3>KIP-824: Allowing dumping segment logs limiting the batches in the output</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-824%3A+Allowing+dumping+segmentlogs+limiting+the+batches+in+the+output">KIP-824</a> allows the kafka-dump-logs tool to be configured to only scan and print the records at the start of the log segment instead of the entire log segment.</p>
<h2>Kafka Streams</h2>
<h3>KIP-846: Source/sink node metrics for consumed/produced throughput in Streams</h3>
<p>
With the metrics available today in the plain consumer it is possible for users of Kafka Streams to derive the consumed throughput of their applications at the subtopology level, but the same is not true for the produced throughput.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=211886093">KIP-846</a> fills in this gap and gives end users a way to compute the production rate of each subtopology by introducing two new metrics for the throughput at sink nodes. Even though it is possible to derive the consumed throughput with existing client level metrics, KIP-846 also adds two new metrics for the throughput at source nodes to provide an equally fine-grained metrics scope as for the newly added metrics at the sink nodes and to simplify the user experience.</p>
<h3>KIP-834: Pause/resume KafkaStreams topologies</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=211882832">KIP-834</a> adds the ability to pause and resume topologies. This can be used to reduce resources used or modify data pipelines. Paused topologies skip processing, punctuation, and standby tasks. For distributed Streams applications, each instance will need to be paused and resumed separately.</p>
<h3>KIP-820: Consolidate KStream transform() and process() methods</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-820%3A+Extend+KStream+process+with+new+Processor+API">KIP-820</a> generalizes the KStream API to consolidate Transformers (which could forward results) and Processors (which could not). The change makes use of the new type-safe Processor API. This simplifies Kafka Streams, making it easier to use and learn.</p>
<h3>KIP-812: Introduce another form of the KafkaStreams.close() API that forces the member to leave the consumer group</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-812%3A+Introduce+another+form+of+the+%60KafkaStreams.close%28%29%60+API+that+forces+the+member+to+leave+the+consumer+group">KIP-812</a> can efficiently close the stream permanently by forcing the member to leave the consumer group.</p>
<h2>Kafka Connect</h2>
<h3>KIP-618: Exactly once support for source connectors</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-618%3A+Exactly-Once+Support+for+Source+Connectors">KIP-618</a> adds exactly one semantic support to source connectors. The Connect framework was expanded to atomically write source records and their source offsets to Apache Kafka, and to prevent zombie tasks from producing data to Apache Kafka.</p>
