<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><i><b>Standards-based, Content and<br />
Metadata Detection and Analysis Toolkit Powers Large-scale,<br />
Multi-lingual, Multi-format Repositories at Adobe, the Internet<br />
Archive, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and more.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>9 November 2011 &mdash;FOREST HILL, MD&mdash;<br />
</b>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer<br />
developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source<br />
projects and initiatives, today announced Apache Tika v1.0, an<br />
embeddable, lightweight toolkit for content detection and analysis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">"The Apache Tika v1.0 release is five<br />
years in the making, providing numerous improvements and new parsing<br />
formats," said Chris Mattmann, Apache Tika Vice President, Senior<br />
Computer Scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and University<br />
of Southern California Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer<br />
Science. "From a toolkit perspective, it's easy to integrate, and<br />
provides maximum functionality with little configuration."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">With the increasing amount of<br />
information available on the Internet today, automatic information<br />
processing and retrieval is urgently needed to understand content<br />
across cultures, languages, and continents.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Apache Tika is a one-stop shop for<br />
identifying, retrieving, and parsing text and metadata from over<br />
1,200 file formats including HTML, XML, Microsoft Office,<br />
OpenOffice/OpenDocument, PDF, images, ebooks/EPUB, Rich Text,<br />
compression and packaging formats, text/audio/image/video, Java class<br />
files and archives, email/mbox, and more.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Tika entered the Apache Incubator in<br />
2007, became a sub-project of Apache Lucene in 2008, and graduated as<br />
an ASF Top-level Project (TLP) in April 2010. Apache Tika has been<br />
tested extensively in repositories exceeding 500 million documents<br />
across a variety of applications in industry, academia and government<br />
labs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">"At NASA, we leverage Apache Tika<br />
on several of our Earth science data system projects," explained<br />
Dan Crichton, Program Manager and Principal Computer Scientist, NASA<br />
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Tika helps us processes hundreds of<br />
terabytes of scientific data in myriad formats and their associated<br />
metadata models. Using Tika with other Apache technologies such as<br />
OODT, Lucene, and Solr, we are able to automate, virtualize and<br />
increase the efficiency of NASA's<br />
science data processing pipeline."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Users<br />
and software applications use Apache Tika to explore the information<br />
landscape through flexible interfaces in Java, from the command line,<br />
REST-ful Web services, and also by consuming its functionality from a<br />
multitude of programming languages directly, including Python, .NET<br />
and C++. Tika defines a standard application programming interface<br />
(API) and makes use of existing libraries such Apache POI and PDFBox<br />
to detect and extract metadata and structured text content from<br />
various documents using existing parser libraries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">"We've used Apache Tika<br />
extensively for a wide range of content extraction tasks, including<br />
parsing almost 600 million pages and documents from a large web<br />
crawl," said Ken Krugler, Founder and President of Scale<br />
Unlimited. "It's proven invaluable as a simple yet robust<br />
solution to the challenges of extracting text and metadata from the<br />
jungle of formats you find on the web."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">"Hippo CMS 7 uses Apache Jackrabbit<br />
to index content repositories containing as many as 500,000<br />
documents," explained Arj&eacute; Cahn, CTO of Hippo. "We are exploring<br />
ways that Apache Tika can enhance access to metadata in our faceted<br />
navigation feature, which may result in a possible future patch."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>Availability and Oversight</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As with all Apache products, Apache<br />
Tika software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is<br />
overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the<br />
project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&rsquo;s<br />
day-to-day operations, including community development and product<br />
releases. Apache Tika source code, documentation, and related<br />
resources are available at <a href="http://tika.apache.org/">http://tika.apache.org/</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>Apache Tika in Action!</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Apache Tika v1.0 will be featured at<br />
ApacheCon's Content Technologies track on 10 November 2011. PMC Chair<br />
Mattmann will describe the modern genesis of the project and its<br />
ecosystem, as well as the newly-launched Manning Publications book,<br />
"Tika in Action" co-authored by Mattmann and Zitting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>About The Apache Software Foundation<br />
(ASF)</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Established in 1999, the all-volunteer<br />
Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source<br />
projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world's most popular<br />
Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as<br />
"The Apache Way," more than 350 individual Members and<br />
3,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available<br />
enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide:<br />
thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache<br />
License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing<br />
lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's<br />
official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US<br />
501(3)(c) not-for-profit charity, funded by individual donations and<br />
corporate sponsors including AMD, Basis Technology, Cloudera,<br />
