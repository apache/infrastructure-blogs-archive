<p>I am very excited to announce that <a href="http://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a> 0.9.1 has been released. It's our second release as an Apache Top-level Project. Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. The project entered Apache Incubator in 2013 and was originally created at LinkedIn, where it's in production use, and then graduated from Apache Incubator in Jan, 2015. The project is currently under active development from a diverse group of contributors and committers.</p>

<p>A source download of the 0.9.1 release is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/samza/0.9.1">here</a>. The release JARs are also available in <a href="https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/samza/">Apache's Maven repository</a>. See Samza's <a href="http://samza.apache.org/startup/download/">download</a> page for details.</p>

<p>As a bug-fix version, in all, 7 JIRAs were <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SAMZA%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.9.1%20ORDER%20BY%20updated%20DESC">resolved</a> in this release. A few highlights:</p>
