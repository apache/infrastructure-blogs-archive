  content: Couldn't it somehow be merged into LibreOffice? It just seems like the
    logical solution to this whole thing, and since Apache now owns the copyrights,
    not Oracle, there'd be different people deciding what to do.

  content: This project have to be join to LibreOffice. Separated projects like OpenOffice
    and LibreOffice is not a good option to open source world. This situation can
    show lack of cohesion between the open source community. Together you can make
    a much much better project !!!...

  content: Joining efforts with the LibreOffice project sounds like the best way to
    make the most progress on this code base seeing that the community mostly already
    aligned around The Document Foundation.

  content: "I for one would like for OpenOffice.org to remain independent. Besides
    the obvious licensing differences, I wouldn&acute;t like to see Novell&acute;s
    patches for MS-OOXML merged with OO.o, nor  Mono hooks.\r\n\r\nIt&acute;s called
    \"competition\". Let the better open source office suite win.\r\n\r\nFC"

<p>The <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openofficeorg.html">Apache OpenOffice.org (incubator)</a> project was born on Monday, June 13, 2011.&nbsp; Delivery was complicated.&nbsp; The baby&rsquo;s doing fine.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/statements-on-openofficeorg-contribution-to-apache-nasdaq-orcl-1521400.htm">June 1, 2011 announcement</a> of the license grant from Oracle to the Apache Software foundation, there was extensive discussion over the proposal for acceptance of OpenOffice.org as an Apache <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html">incubator project</a>.&nbsp; Before the June 10 voting began, 207 edits had been made to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/OpenOfficeProposal">proposal</a>.&nbsp; Discussion leading up to the vote swamped the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201106.mbox/date">public mailing list</a> used for consideration and oversight of incubator projects.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now taking the baby steps that will lead us to a healthy, thriving project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The open, public developers list, <font face="Courier New"><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-ooo-dev/">ooo-dev</a></font>, is operating and active.&nbsp; Anyone can subscribe and post.&nbsp; Anyone can access the archive.  </li>
<li>There is a fledgling <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Wiki+Home">Community Wiki</a>.&nbsp; Anyone can subscribe and post.&nbsp; Anyone can access the wiki.  </li>
<li>There is also a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOODEV/Wiki+Home">Developer Wiki</a>.&nbsp; Contributions here are treated as deliverables of the project.&nbsp; Anyone can access the wiki, but contributions to this wiki require submission of an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Apache Contributor License Agreement</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps this wiki could have a better name?  </li>
<li>There is a <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/">project web site</a>.&nbsp; The content is rather thin at the moment.&nbsp; It is growing.  </li>
<li>
<div align="left">There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ooo/">a place</a> in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a> repository for all of the source code.&nbsp; At the moment that consists of tools and the project web site pages (created in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>).</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The gathering of contributors for the project is continuing.&nbsp; In the status of many of the incubating podlings, you&rsquo;ll find the OpenOffice.org <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/July2011">podling&rsquo;s first check-up</a>.&nbsp; (Scroll down through the alphabetical list.)&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">There is more to do, especially around migration of the sites and their artifacts from their OpenOffice.org homes to their Apache counterparts.&nbsp; There are more tasks to accomplish than the number already completed.</p>
<p align="left">Everyone wants to know how soon there will be another OpenOffice.org release and how rapidly everything can be up and running.&nbsp; So do we.&nbsp; Apache OpenOffice.org will be different.&nbsp; The differences may be unrecognizable, but they will be there.&nbsp; Establishing what it takes to reach a sustainable, supported release process as an Apache project is where we first begin by crawling, next to walk, and then to run</p>
<p align="left">This blog is a place for listening to the heartbeat and taking the pulse of the effort as it unfolds.</p>
