  content: 'Firstly, thanks for you hard work! I have a question to do: When Netbeans
    will be focused on Apache Ant projects, like it ever was? I hate the f**** Maven
    and is sad to me to try make a openJFX app with Ant based and it dont work. So,
    please, make Netbeans to be what it was before Oracle abandon the project. Please!'

  content: Ant, Maven, Gradle all have a place in the ecosystem. Ant is still support
    in netbeans and there is no sign that it will be removed. But people have a reason
    to move build systems and you should respect that. If you think there is something
    missing for ant projects in netbeans, you are welcome to join the development
    team and provide fixes and enhancements.

  content: 'Just FYI: Oracle hasn''t abandoned NetBeans at all, in fact, about 50%
    of the contributors to Apache NetBeans are Oracle employees. Re Ant: everything
    should work as always, if not, this is where you''re going to go, i.e., the mailing
    lists (https://netbeans.apache.org/community/mailing-lists.html) or file an issue
    (https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NETBEANS).'

<p>Check out a great series of articles on a killer combination, by Chris Luff&#8212;Apache NetBeans, OpenJFX, and AdoptOpenJDK.</p>
<p>In part one you see how to get a modular JavaFX application built and running from NetBeans. In part two, you look at generating, from Maven, a runtime to execute the application. In part 3, you learn about the distribution of the new application.</p>
<p>Here are the three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/adoptopenjdk-11-openjfx-netbeans">AdoptOpenJDK 11 + OpenJFX + NetBeans: Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/adoptopenjdk-11-openjfx-netbeans-part-2">AdoptOpenJDK 11 + OpenJFX + NetBeans: Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/adoptopenjdk-11-openjfx-netbeans-part-3">AdoptOpenJDK 11 + OpenJFX + NetBeans: Part 3</a></li>
