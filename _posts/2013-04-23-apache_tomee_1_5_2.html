<p>The Apache TomEE project is proud to announce the availability of <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/downloads.html">TomEE 1.5.2</a>, a maintenance release focused on driving stability and maturity into the 1.5.x codebase.  The 1.5.2 release does contain minor new features and improvements around tooling, such as the Arquillian adapters and TomEE Maven Plugin as well as key upgrades such as Tomcat 7.0.39 and OpenWebBeans 1.1.8.  The vast majority of server-side new features and improvements are targeted at the coming TomEE 1.6.0 which has a very strong performance focus, specifically for small devices such as the Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>In keeping with the project's open focus on delivering frequent releases and builds, the project has setup infrastructure for <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/download/index.html">publishing builds</a> of both stable (1.5.x) and development (1.6.x) branches of TomEE.  We invite all members of the community to become part of the development process by trying builds out early, giving feedback and making feature requests.</p>
<p>The project would like to thank all members of the community who gave feedback to 1.5.2 and are actively working with us on creating the best possible 1.6.0.  Our user list traffic continues to expand at exponential rates (5x over last year and growing) and we're doing everything we can do to deliver you more TomEE, faster and better.  Keeping a focus on maintenance releases while we chase down the next latest and greatest TomEE version is our way of sending a very deep and heartfelt thank you.</p>
