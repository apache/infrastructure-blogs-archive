<p>As some of you are aware, there have been some issues syncing changes from repositories on <a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org">https://git-wip-us.apache.org</a> to the mirrors on GitHub.</p></p>
<p>The issues we are seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull requests not being closed when they should be</li>
<li>Changes not being synced to the GitHub mirrors</li>
<li>Bots other than asfgit closing PRs on Apache GitHub mirrors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking into why changes are not being synced, as well as why PRs are not getting closed and why some PRs are being closed by other bots such as hubot.</p></p>
<p>We will update this blog post as we get more information about the sync issues.</p>
