<meta name="description" content="Advanced Open Source framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing applications used by global systems integrators, Cloud software and service providers, and major enterprises across financial services, supply chain management, and more. Wakefield, MA &mdash;3 March 2020&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache&reg; BrooklynTM v1.0, the latest version of the Open Source framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing applications. &quot;I am excited to see the 1.0 release of Apache Brooklyn,&quot; said Geoff Macartney, Vice President of Apache Brooklyn. &quot;This reflects the maturity and stability that Brooklyn has reached after nearly five years as a Top-Level Apache project.&quot; Apache Brooklyn provides a single tool that includes a REST API and GUI for: managing provisioning and application deployment; monitoring an application&rsquo;s health and metrics; understanding the dependencies between components; and&nbsp; applying complex policies to manage the application.

Blueprints can be treated as an integral part of the application, and as modular components that can be composed and reused in many ways.

Brooklyn&rsquo;s design is influenced by Autonomic computing and promise theory and implements the OASIS CAMP and TOSCA standards. Apache Brooklyn 1.0 highlights include: Support for public and private clouds, available out-of-the-box thanks to integrated Apache jclouds, as well as private infrastructure A modern, user-friendly, web-based UI including the drag-and-drop Blueprint Composer REST API and CLI tools, suitable for power users, automation and scripting A stable blueprint language and API &ldquo;Batteries included&rdquo; entities and policies covering clusters, auto-scaling, replacing unhealthy components, and more &quot;Apache Brooklyn has been in use for some time in production environments,&quot; said Richard Downer, Apache Brooklyn 1.0 release manager. &quot;I&rsquo;m delighted we can now announce our 1.0 release.
