<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta5 requires a minimum of Java 6 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
