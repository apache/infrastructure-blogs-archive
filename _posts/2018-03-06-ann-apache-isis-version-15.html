<p>The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis v1.16.2</p>
<p>This is primarily a maintenance fix release fixing one severe error in 1.16.1 relating to parented checkboxes.&nbsp; It does however introduce one new feature for the REST API (RO viewer) to support generic RO clients. There is also one notable performance improvement through the caching of JAXBContexts.</p>
<p>Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].</p>
<p>You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2].&nbsp; Alternatively, download the release and build it from source [3].</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
