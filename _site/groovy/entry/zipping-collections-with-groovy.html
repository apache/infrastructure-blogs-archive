<h3>Groovy</h3>
<p><a href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> uses the <code>transpose</code> method for zipping:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/67ebb175-e131-43d3-99a6-93ee295d98e7" alt="ZippingCollectionsGroovy.png"></p>
<h3>Eclipse Collections</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/collections/" target="_blank">Eclipse Collections</a> has a <code>zip</code> method on its list classes:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/372e7ece-5b2e-4257-936a-5586c5264732" alt="ZippingCollectionsEC.png"></p>
<h3>Guava</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/google/guava" target="_blank">Guava</a> has a streams utility class with a <code>zip</code> method:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/c09f2360-15b5-4d55-b1ca-e60fb64b1a56" alt="ZippingCollectionsGuava.png"></p>
<h3>StreamEx</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/amaembo/streamex" target="_blank">StreamEx</a> provides an enhanced stream library which supports <code>zipWith</code>:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/ceb0bd2e-378d-4d84-bd24-42978a17f4f4" alt="ZippingCollectionsStreamEx.png"></p>
<h3>Vavr</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr" target="_blank">Vavr</a> has a <code>zipWith</code> method on its list class:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/55f1456a-cdcf-4ac5-9428-3423380c902e" alt="ZippingCollectionsVavr.png"></p>
<h3>jOO&lambda;</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOL" target="_blank">jOO&lambda;</a> has a <code>zip</code> method for its sequences:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/4f4de9e9-d75f-401a-9adc-cb3673e12bb8" alt="ZippingCollectionsJool.png"></p>
<h3>Groovy GQuery</h3>
<p>If you are a fan of query-like DSLs, Groovy's language integrated query, <i>gquery</i>, can also be used:</p>
<p><img style="width:100%" src="https://blogs.apache.org/groovy/mediaresource/2a95e003-cce5-4c1b-8979-06b0747d438e" alt="ZippingCollectionsGQ.png"></p>
<p>This uses a special <code>_rn</code> "row number" pre-defined variable in GQ expressions. It follows the same strategy as the IntStream "<i>workaround</i>" for Java mentioned in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-collections-zip" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
