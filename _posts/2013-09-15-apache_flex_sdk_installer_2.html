  content: "A.  flex-sdk-description.xml says that I just installed build 1447119.
    \ Is that correct?  That is exactly the build that the installer reported when
    I ran it on March 2nd.\r\n\r\nB.  The installer installs playerglobal.swc 11.1.
    \ Why are you not installing the swc for the current Flash Player?  Who is interested
    in software that is two years old?\r\n\r\nC.  The installer overlays AIR 3.4 --
    same question -- when will the installer provide software that is at least close
    to the runtimes being shipped by Adobe?\r\n\r\n"

  content: "@Terry,\r\n\r\nThis is a release of the new version of the Apache Flex
    SDK *Installer* alone.  It will continue to install the most recently released
    version of the Flex SDK, i.e. Flex 4.9.1.  You should see the same version of
    Flex using this Installer as well.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOm"

  content: "@Terry The develop branch of the SDK has been updated with work with FP
    11.7 and AIR 3.7 but has not been fully tested. You might want to look in the
    ide directory of the develop branch for scripts to update FP and AIR versions
    (for OSX). The next version of the installer is likely to let you select which
    version of AIR/FP you want."

    more visual editor, and still doesnt work on Linux ..\r\n\r\nBut is here a major
    improvement somewhere ? (I mean new components etc...) "

  content: Hey, does Apache Flex has any plan working on improving the performance
    of AIR mobile app? Such as GPU accelerated using Starling and Stage3D with Flex
    SDK, like FeatherUI. Personally, I felt that going align with Adobe AIR and Flash
    Player would be better than moving away from it. We don't really like HTML5 even
    though one day Flex might be able to output HTML5 app with FlexJS, we still prefer
    SWF format with no browser incompatibilities issues. Thanks for all the good works!

  content: Feather - good example how flex might be reincarnated. It would be really
    cool to see any movements in "Stage3D" direction.

  content: Hi, May be this is not the proper place to write but I am trying all around
    until I get an answer. At my company we have developed a framework in apache flex
    which is oriented to business applications. We were wondering if we could add
    our project to the apache projects so it could be developed further by a broader
    community. We are actively using and developing the framework for our enterprise
    applications. If someone can give me some directions we would really appreciate
    that.

    should hopefully contain the new experimental components.  \r\n\r\nA.  We have

    and the benefit of the fixes you have been applying, we await not a new release
    of the installer but a new release of the framework sdk itself.\r\n\r\nA.  When
    is the expected release of 4.9.2 or whatever it will be called?\r\n\r\nB.  When
    you provide that release will it be tested for building applications to run against
    the current AIR runtime,  3.7?"

The Apache Flex team is pleased to announce the availability of the Apache Flex SDK Installer 2.5.4 release. The source distributions and installer binaries can be downloaded here:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/installer.html">http://flex.apache.org/installer.html</a></p>
<p>*About the Apache Flex SDK Installer* The Apache Flex SDK Installer AIR application provides an easy, single-click installation of the Apache Flex SDK and all its dependencies. This will make it suitable for working with IDEs such as Adobe Flash Builder, FDT, IntelliJ IDEA, FlashDevelop, etc. This tool is intended to allow end users to start building their Apache Flex application within minutes. This also lets you seamlessly transition from older SDKs to the latest Apache Flex SDK release.</p>
<p>The application downloads the following:</p>
<p>- Apache Flex SDK<br />
- The AIR SDK (Windows vs. Mac) based on the current platform<br />
- Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc<br />
- SwfObject<br />
- Open Source Media Framework (OSMF)<br />
- Adobe Text Layout Format (TLF)</p>
<p>Optionally, the application will download these files if the user wants:</p>
<p>- Adobe BlazeDS<br />
- Adobe Embedded Font Support</p>
<p>The application ships with an auto-update functionality that will prompt the users to upgrade to the latest version when a new release is made available.</p>
<p>We have made available an installer badge at <a href="http://flex.apache.org/download-utilities.html">http://flex.apache.org/download-utilities.html</a>. If you have a blog or a website, you can copy-paste the html code snippet which will help more and more end users to very easily get access to the Apache Flex SDK. They will be able to get setup and start coding within minutes.</p>
