    IDE 10.0 Vote Candidate 2\" mentioned in the Community Acceptance Survey form.
    Or is that an old form?\r\nThanks.\r\nKind regards\r\nV&iacute;t"

  content: "My project is java ant web app, which I normally open with 8.2 (or 9 if
    I install de Java EE Base module).\r\n                                                                                                                                                      \r\nAs
    expected, netbeans 10 wouldn't recognize my project out of the box, so I tried
    to install Java EE Base trough the 8.2 Plugin distribution portal like we did
    with Netbeans 9 (http://updates.netbeans.org/netbeans/updates/8.2/uc/final/distribution/catalog.xml.gz)
    and got the following error.\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/7pcGzxNP (pastebin link
    becuase comments doesn't allow more than 1000 char)\r\n\r\nNow, I know Java EE
    related libs have been removed from the JDK, &iquest;But does that mean that you'll
    remove Java EE functionality from the IDE? I don't know If I should file an issue
    or not because I don't know if this is expected behavior. \r\n\r\nIt should be
    noted that after hitting \"Disable modules and continue\" everything seem to be
    working fine, for example, even after getting the message \"JSP Editor - The module
    named org.netbeans.modules.web.el was needed and not found\" expression language
    seem to be working fine while editing JSP.\r\n\r\nI have another newer smaller
    java web project but this one is maven-based, and NB10 recognized it out of the
    box, so I don't know if there is something in my ant-based project that I would
    have to update to make it NB10 recognize it without having to install Java EE
    Base module (if indeed you intend to remove it)\r\n\r\nMy project is not really
    Java EE , its more \"Java EE Web Profile\" (Mainly Servlet/JSP) but since it was
    created with a very old version of netbeans, j2ee.platform is set to 1.5 in project.properties,
    I'll experiment with that value during the weekend.\r\n\r\nCheers, and thank you
    for your work in Netbeans 10!\r\n"
