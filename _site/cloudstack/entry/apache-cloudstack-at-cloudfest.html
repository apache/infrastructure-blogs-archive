<h2><strong>The Benefits of Apache CloudStack for Cloud Builders</strong></h2>
<p>For businesses entering the public cloud market, finding the software and partners that enable rapid deployment for their customers can be a major obstacle. It can take up a significant amount of time and result in a low ROI if the wrong choices are made when providing public and private cloud solutions.</p>
<p>CloudStack is a turnkey solution for cloud builders and manages service providers. It is completely open-source, easy to implement, manage and scale. Powered by a large open-source community and following rapid release cycles, Apache CloudStack help cloud builders solve their key challenges &ndash; costs, vendor lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical servers installed in geographically distributed data centers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Apache CloudStack</strong> <strong>at CloudFest</strong></h2>
<p>Being part of CloudFest is an essential step for our community to meet existing users from the cloud industry and show all the improvements and enhancements in the project. Additionally, we hope to be able to meet people interested in contributing to open-source projects and engage them with Apache CloudStack.</p>
<p>We will also be excited to discuss Apache CloudStack with new potential users and technologies which would like to integrate with us.</p>
