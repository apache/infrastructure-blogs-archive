<meta name="description" content="Welcome to the Apache Aries group blog! Although I can&#39;t really call it a group blog right now because I am the only person that can write entries - this&nbsp; will change very soon, twelve people have asked for IDs and I&#39;m hoping it won&#39;t be long before they can write. The point of a group blog is to be able to have a place to talk about the project, I hope that means that many people will contribute, each sharing a different view point. Of course, all the important issues will continue to be discussed on the mailing list - this isn&#39;t the right place to argue over unresolved technical issues. This is a place to celebrate achievements and to talk about some of the new and exciting things we are doing. &nbsp;I&#39;m in the lucky position of being completely new to all of this, Apache, Aries, OSGi, Maven.... everything, although I have worked on open source code for the past 5 years. I say lucky because I&#39;m approaching this from the same point of view as some of the people who will use code from Aries so I&#39;m busy asking beginners questions and making beginners mistakes. As I start to understand things I will write them down, I hope this will make it easier for other newcomers.&nbsp; Yesterday I added a HelloWorld Blueprint tutorial to the Aries website. It&#39;s very simple and just demonstrates some of the features of the Blueprint container. If you get a chance to test it and can see ways to improve it please let me know. &nbsp;Zo&euml; &nbsp; &nbsp;" />
