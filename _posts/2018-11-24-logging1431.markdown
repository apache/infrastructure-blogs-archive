Volkan Yaz覺c覺 released log4j2-logstash-layout v0.15.
<p>
From the announcement message on the log4j-user mailing list:
<p>
In addition to the <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/manual/layouts.html#JSONLayout">default JSONLayout</a> shipped in Log4j 2, there is also another layout plugin that you
can use to render customized JSONs: log4j2-logstash-layout (<a href="https://github.com/vy/log4j2-logstash-layout">https://github.com/vy/log4j2-logstash-layout</a>). 
<p>
A couple of hours ago I released v0.15 of the plugin to Maven Central. This release ships
a garbage-free implementation that makes <b>log4j2-logstash-layout the
fastest and only garbage-free JSON layout</b> plugin out there in the wild. If
you have a use case for JSON layout, you should definitely give
log4j2-logstash-layout a try.
<p>
Feedback is welcome!
