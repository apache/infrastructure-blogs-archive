<h5>Apache CouchDB 1.5.1 released</h5>
<p>This is a security release. <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/#download">Download link</a> | <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/couchdb/entry/apache_couchdb_1_5_1">Release notes</a></p>
<h4>Blog Posts</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/couchdb/entry/couchdb_and_the_heartbleed_ssl">CouchDB and the Heartbleed SSL/TLS Vulnerability</a></li>
<li>A new series in this our blog: "The Little Things" that are great about CouchDB - because it's always <em>the little things</em>. The first post: "<a href="https://blogs.apache.org/couchdb/entry/the_little_things_1_do">Do Not Delete - where I explain how we help users not accidentally lose their data</a>"</li>
</ul>
<h4>Major Discussions</h4>
<h5>Writing many docs at once: bench marking a 10k write to a CouchDB server (see thread <a href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=Bench%20marking%20a%20simple%2010k%20write#query:Bench%20marking%20a%20simple%2010k%20write%20list%3Aorg.apache.couchdb.user%20order%3Adate-backward+page:3+mid:b7qc5ycxbigm2rgb+state:results">here</a>)</h5>
<p>A discussion around handling and measurements of bulk input in CouchDB.</p>
<h5>Question about "complex" range queries (see thread <a href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=question+about+%22complex%22+range+queries+couchdb#query:question%20about%20complex%20range%20queries%20couchdb%20list%3Aorg.apache.couchdb.user%20date%3A201404%20order%3Adate-backward+page:2+mid:sv4wjlt3cfsds455+state:results">here</a>)</h5>
<p>Requirements for sort orders of data views.</p>
<h5>Is the revision field deterministic? (see thread <a href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=Is+the+revision+field+deterministic%3F+couchdb#query:Is%20the%20revision%20field%20deterministic%3F%20couchdb%20list%3Aorg.apache.couchdb.user%20date%3A201404%20order%3Adate-backward+page:2+mid:pqvewkbrtoknoezl+state:results">here</a>)</h5>
<p>Quoting Robert Samuel Newson's <a href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=Is+the+revision+field+deterministic%3F+couchdb#query:Is%20the%20revision%20field%20deterministic%3F%20couchdb%20list%3Aorg.apache.couchdb.user%20date%3A201404%20order%3Adate-backward+page:2+mid:kmbimqhft5lmcpnb+state:results">reply</a>: "Yes, it&rsquo;s deterministic. The same document with the same history will have the same _rev value. This is an optimization over the previous algorithm where _rev was a random UUID. [&hellip;] The advantage is that two servers receiving the same update can more optimally replicate. They still have to check that the target has all _id/_rev pairs but will usually be able to skip actually transmitting document and attachment content."</p>
