  <h3><span style="font-family: arial, verdana, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans&quot;, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.018em;">Schedule Now Available</span></h3> 
  <div>The full program is now available online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apachecon.com/">https://www.apachecon.com/</a> and features talks representing dozens of our projects. Through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, workshops, hackathons, BarCamps, and more, participants will learn about Open Source development &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, in a deliberately intimate, collaborative, vendor-neutral environment. Program categories and project tracks will include Big Data, Content Delivery, Geospatial, IoT, Machine Learning, Streaming, and more.</div>
