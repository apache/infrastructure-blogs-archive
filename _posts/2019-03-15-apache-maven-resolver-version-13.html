<p>The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the<br />
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/resolver/index.html">Apache Maven Resolver, version 1.3.3</a></p>
<p>Apache Maven Artifact Resolver is a library for working with artifact<br />
repositories and dependency resolution.</p>
<p>Maven Artifact Resolver deals with the specification of local repository,<br />
remote repository, developer workspaces, artifact transports and artifact<br />
resolution.</p>
<p>It is expected to be extended by concrete repository implementation, like Maven<br />
Artifact Resolver Provider for Maven repositories or any other provider for<br />
other repository formats.</p>
<p>You can download the appropriate sources etc. from the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/resolver/download.cgi">download page</a>.</p>
