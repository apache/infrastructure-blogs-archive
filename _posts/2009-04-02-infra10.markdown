<p>Last week (at ApacheCon 2009 EU) I gave a session talk about &quot;Subversion on-the-fly Replication&quot; and how we (ASF) deployed such an setup last year with in the Apache Software Foundation.&nbsp; So check out the slides if you are interested in how it works, why you should do it, what are the known problems and the solutions etc..</p><p>&nbsp;<a title="Subversion on-the-fly Replication" href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/sessions/177">Slides </a><br /></p><p>&nbsp;Thanks to all the people who attended the session I (we) are still open for good suggestions and feedback ;-)&nbsp;</p><p> There is no need for being sad if you missed the session talk, it was recorded as part of the &quot;HTTP Server Administration&quot; track. You can register for it <a href="http://streaming.linux-magazin.de/en/program_apachecon09.htm" title="Recorded Session Talk">HERE</a><br /></p><p> Ps: Thanks to Tony Stevenson to act as my session chair and to Paul Querna to help out on answering questions ;)<br /></p>
