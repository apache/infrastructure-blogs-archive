<p>Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)! This month we have lots of news about ApacheCon North America; share some links to some of the conference keynotes; deliver a co-ordinated Apache Way track alongside our Community one; get some feedback from a first time ApacheCon attendee; encourage you to listen to ApacheCon via our FeatherCast podcast channel and we run yet another successful BarCampApache.</p>
<h2>ApacheCon NA 2017</h2>
<p>After all the preparation ApacheCon North America took place this month in Miami. As well as the standard ApacheCon and Big Data tracks, several mini conferences were held around the main event. It also featured a new Apache Way track which is mentioned in separate section below in more detail.</p>
<p>ApacheCon featured some great keynote speakers with some interesting topics from IoT to Digital Pychometrics. If you haven't had a chance to hear or see them then they are all available on Youtube as follows:</p>

<p>During ApacheCon Benjamin Young organised a ComDev Tools Hackathon where people interested in improving some of our tools got together and started working on it. Thanks very much to Benjamin for this initiative and to all the hackathon participants who came along to help out. </p>
<h2>BarCampApache</h2>
<p>Our BarCampApache was a great success and attracted well over 35 people. It was facilitated by Jean-Frederic Clere and some of our attendees on the day. It was great to see so much involvement from people from a wide range of Apache projects. </p>
<p>The following were some of the topics raised by our partitcipants and discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>MQ in Practice</li>
<li>Community Engagement & How to Atract More Contributors / Committers </li>
<li>Benchmarking </li>
<li>Open Source in China</li>
<li>Orchestraiton</li>
<li>YARN/MESOS</li>
<li>Static Analysis and Project Management</l></ul>
<p>At every BarCampApache a key theme is sharing information and advice as well as making contacts, and I'm sure we succeeded in doing that. How do we know? The discussions kept on well after the time when we were planning to finish!</p>
<p>So thanks again to everyone that attended and we hope that you will pass on your experiences to other colleagues and encourage them to participate at future events. </p>
<p>The audio from the <a href="https://feathercast.apache.org/2017/05/30/apachecon-miami-2017-barcampapache/" target="_blank"> BarCampApache is available on FeatherCast</a>.<br />
(<strong>WARNING</strong>: This current file is over 5 and a half hours long but we will be splitting this up into more topic based discussions) </p>
<h2>The Apache Way Track and Community Track</h2>
<p>As well as our usual community based track, for the first time at ApacheCon a co-ordinated track detailing different aspects of the Apache Way was organised by Shane Curcuru and Nick Burch. The five presentations and one panel discussion incorporated common themes and explored some of the challenges encountered. </p>

<h2>First Time ApacheCon Experience - Stephen Downie</h2>

<br/>Stephen's full blog post can be found here.  <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/comdev/entry/my-first-experience-of-apachecon" target="_blank">My First Experience of ApacheCon Blog Post by Stephen Downie</a></p>
<h2>OpenExpo in Madrid</h2>
<p>During May we promoted that we had been invited to have an Apache booth at the Open Expo in Madrid on 1st June. This is a new event for us and we wanted to find out whether it could be a good place to have an Apache presence at in the future. We understand that the conference had over 3000 visitors and 300 of them passed by our Apache booth not only to pick up stickers but to also find out more about the Foundation itself. Please take a look at  <a href="https://s.apache.org/9uem" target="_blank">our detailed blog post about the event.</a> </p>
<p>A big thank you to Ignasi Barrera, Jan Iversen and Sharan Foga who spent the day on booth duty during the event. </p>
