You can install and use OpenOffice, with no subscription fees -- ever.&nbsp; Updates are free as well. School districts, by using OpenOffice in the classroom, can save money in their budget, but also allow their students (and their parents) to run the same software at home for free.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the open source advantage. OpenOffice works the same on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.&nbsp; You are not trapped in a single operating system. OpenOffice speaks your language.&nbsp; It is available in over 20 languages, with many more translations in progress. You can run OpenOffice from a USB-stick and so work everywhere using your personal settings, even if OpenOffice is not yet installed on your friend&#39;s PC.&nbsp; There are over 1000 document templates for OpenOffice, free to download, including many templates designed for education. OpenOffice is extensible with 100&#39;s of free extensions that you can download. As an all-volunteer open source project we welcome students, teachers and parents interested in helping us develop the next great version of OpenOffice. Learn new skills and gain valuable experience working on an open source project, while helping to improve the tools that you use yourself.
