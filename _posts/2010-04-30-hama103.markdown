We're introduced in the BSP Worldwide : <a href="http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/bspww3000.html">http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/bspww3000.html</a> via Prof. Rob Bisseling.

<pre>Dear Edward,

I have put a link from  http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/bspww3000.html 
to your page and to the paper. 

I read it and find it very interesting. 
I heard a talk by Greg Malewicz from Google (Pregel) who is very enthousiastic about BSP. 
Suddenly I note a high interest in BSP everywhere.

I wish you good luck with your project.

best wishes,
Rob</pre>
