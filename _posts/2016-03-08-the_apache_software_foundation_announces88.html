<div><b><i>Advanced distributed stream processing framework performs 50x faster than other real-time computation systems</p>
<p></i></b></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;8 March 2016&mdash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache&reg; Flink&trade; v1.0, the advanced Open Source distributed real-time stream processing system.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Flink is an easy to use, yet sophisticated Open Source stream processor, with recent test results clocking in at least 50x faster than other distributed real-time computation systems.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Releasing Flink 1.0 is the most important milestone in the project since graduation to a top-level Apache project one year ago," said Stephan Ewen, Vice President of Apache Flink and co-founder/CTO of data Artisans. "This is a collective achievement of more than 150 individuals that have contributed code to date."</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Under The Hood</b></div>
<div>Flink uniquely supports a combination of features that include flexible windowing on event time, out-of-order stream handling, high availability, and exactly-once guarantees, together with high event throughput and low processing latency.</div>
<div></div>
<div>V.1.0 furthers Apache Flink's maturity, making it significantly easier to program, deploy, and maintain Flink pipelines at scale by:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>initiating backwards compatibility of public APIs against all 1.x.y versions;</li>
<li>introducing functionality for complex event processing (CEP);</li>
<li>supporting large state beyond memory limits;</li>
<li>supporting state versioning and savepoints; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>improving the system's monitoring functionality</li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>"Flink v1.0 is indeed a testament to the maturity of the platform, which now enjoys production use at Fortune Global 500, as well as leading tech companies," said Kostas Tzoumas, member of the Apache Flink Project Management Committee, and co-founder/CEO of data Artisans.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Google congratulates the Apache Flink community for this achievement," said William Vambenepe, Lead Product Manager for Big Data on Google Cloud Platform. "Flink is unlocking the richness of stream processing at scale, and delivering on the promise of the Dataflow Programming Model for all users, anywhere. We look forward to continuing to work with the Flink community, including further unification of APIs as part of Apache Beam (incubating)."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"At King.com we are using Flink to process more than 30 billion events daily, leveraging Flink's stateful streaming abstractions," said Christofer Waldenstr&ouml;m, Team Lead for Streaming Platform at King.com. "We find that Flink provides a convenient way to interact with real-time data for complex streaming use-cases involving large state beyond memory."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Flink proved to be a valuable framework in our day-to-day business. It helps us to process log events, aggregate tracking information, apply filters and decide upon message routing," said Christian Kreutzfeldt, Senior Solution Developer &amp; Architect at Otto Group BI. "We are still excited to see how fast new applications can be implemented and deployed. Even complex requirements do not constitute a significant challenge. For the upcoming version 1.0 we are looking forward to see a stabilized API and the advanced monitoring features. Especially the back pressure monitoring could become a great tool to understand internal processing behavior much better. Furthermore from an enterprise user perspective we are happy to see that Apache Flink finally reached version 1.0 which typically opens the door to the broader enterprise market."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Flink originated at the Stratosphere research project that started in 2009 by the Technical University of Berlin, along with several other European universities. The project was submitted to the Apache Incubator in April 2014 and became an Apache Top-Level Project in December 2014.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today, Flink among the ASF's dynamic Big Data projects, with more than 150 contributors to date, a wealth of production deployments, and commercial support by data Artisans, a company founded by the core team that originally developed Flink.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"The two things that have always struck me about Flink has been the excellence of the code and the excellence of the team," said Ted Dunning, Vice President of the Apache Incubator and Chief Application Architect at MapR. "This pattern is continuing with this release."</div>
<div></div>
