<meta name="description" content="I am very excited to announce that Apache Samza 0.9.0 has been released. It&#39;s our first release as an Apache Top-level Project. Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. The project entered Apache Incubator in 2013 and was originally created at LinkedIn, where it&#39;s in production use, and then graduated from Apache Incubator in Jan, 2015. The project is currently under active development from a diverse group of contributors and committers. A source download of the 0.9.0 release is available here. The release JARs are also available in Apache&#39;s Maven repository. See Samza&#39;s download page for details. In all, 95 JIRAs were resolved in this release. A few highlights: Improved the RocksDB performance (SAMZA-543) Allowed to publish container logs to a stream to integrate with ELK. (SAMZA-310, SAMZA-479, SAMZA-597) Provided a way to flag sensitive information in config (SAMZA-589) Upgraded to Kafka 0.8.2.1 which improved the whole system performance (SAMZA-227, SAMZA-599) Added integration test for the whole system (SAMZA-394, SAMZA-468) Allowed offset override in Task init phase (SAMZA-568) Provided simple serde configuration (SAMZA-554) Fixed some bugs in system consumer side (SAMZA-579, SAMZA-590, SAMZA-591, etc) We&#39;ve also made a lot of community progress during this release: Successfully graduated from Apache Incubator Added 8 more companies in the powered by page (Intuit, VinTank, DoubleDutch, Banno, Metamarkets, Digitalsmiths, Happy Pancake, Quantiply) First Samza meetup Accepted patches from 22 distinct contributors. 917 emails sent to the developer mailing list in past 3 months There are a lot to exciting features to expect in our future release. Some of them are: Samza standalone mode (SAMZA-516) Yarn host affinity (SAMZA-617) State store debugging tool (SAMZA-598) Configure Samza jobs through a stream (SAMZA-348) 0.9.0 release will be our last release to support java 1.6. We will require java 1.7+ since 0.10.0 release. Now is a good time to get involved. You can start by running through the hello-samza tutorial, signing up for the mailing list, and grabbing some newbie JIRAs. I&#39;d like to close by thanking everyone who&#39;s been involved in the project. It&#39;s been a great experience to be involved in this community, and I look forward to its continued growth." />
