  content: "I do not know what I would&rsquo;ve carried out in the absence of these
    solutions revealed by you about that concern. It seemed to be the hard setting
    in my status, yet spending time with an expert form you solved it forced me to
    weep over joy. Now I am grateful for the work and even believe you know what a
    great job you were getting into training other people with the aid of your webpage.
    The creative ideas also acted to be the good way to be aware that other people
    have similar dreams just likes my own to learn good deal more with regard to this
    issue. I&rsquo;m certain there are thousands of more fun moments up front for
    many who looked at your blog post.\r\nhttps://usawriters.org"

<p><b>New features and improvement:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch04.html">Ajax</a> support.</li>
<li><a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch02s07.html">Page Action</a> support.         </li>
<li><a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/click-api/org/apache/click/Stateful.html">Stateful</a> Controls.</li>
<li>Improve fields to only be processed if they have an incoming request<br />
                parameter. This improvement streamlines dynamic forms<br />
since fields               added at runtime during s POST request won't<br />
 bind their values and               won't be validated for that<br />
request.  In subsequent requests the Field               will have an<br />
incoming  parameter and so will have it's value bound and<br />
validated.  Another advantage is that dynamically added Fields won't<br />
            have their default value overridden in the POST request they<br />
 were added  in.               This issue has been raised by Nirmal<br />

<li>             Added automapping support for GAE with a caveat that page templates             must be placed under the folders <tt>page</tt> or <tt>pages</tt>.             This issue was raised by Ke Sun             [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLK-639" target="_blank">CLK-639</a>].           </li>

<li>             Added support for loading <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/extras-api/org/apache/click/extras/control/DateField.html">DateField</a>             translations for month and day names from the JDK.

<li>&nbsp;Added support for absolute page classnames when configuring pages               in <tt>click.xml</tt>.

<li>Fixed escaping of control values and attributes to be XML friendly<br />

<li>Added a chapter on <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch04.html">Ajax</a>,           covering <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch04s02.html">AjaxBehaviors</a>,           <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch04s03.html">Ajax execution flow</a>           and a full <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/user-guide/html/ch04s04.html">example</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Removed:</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the ability to automatically <tt>bypass validation</tt><br />
  for           Forms through JavaScript. This ability was added in<br />
2.2.0  but raised           concerns over security and was dropped for<br />
2.3.0.  If you used this           feature in existing applications,<br />
please see  the           <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/upgrade-path.html#removed-bypass-validation">Upgrade path</a>           for a safe alternative to <tt>bypass validation</tt>. We apologize for           the inconvenience. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Deprecated:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated stateful page support: <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/click-api/org/apache/click/Page.html#setStateful%28boolean%29">Page.setStateful()</a>.           </li>
<li class="change">           Stateful pages had the following issues:           <br /> 
<ul>
<li>             Stateful pages was introduced to make it easier to<br />
 store page state across             multiple HTTP requests. However<br />
developing a stateful page is very different             from developing<br />
  a stateless one and this lead to Click applications that are<br />
    inconsistent and harder to maintain.             </li>
<li>             In addition stateful page support has never been<br />
implemented consistently             across the framework and some<br />
components did not work correctly.             </li>
<li>             Stateful pages are very coarse grained, making it<br />
difficult to control             which objects are stored in the<br />
session.             </li>
<li>             Stateful pages have also introduced unnecessary<br />
complexity in the framework             itself, which can now be phased<br />
 out.             </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately there is no direct upgrade path from a stateful page.<br />
            However the majority of use cases are catered for by the new<br />
  stateful           support in the controls: Table, Form, TabbedPanel,<br />
 Field and AbstractLink.         </p>
</li>
</ul>
