<p>After 4 years of existence, the <a href="http://user.services.openoffice.org/">Community Forum</a> has moved on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) servers at the end of October 2011 (see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Changes+integrate+the+forums+into+the+AOOo+project">details</a>).<br />
 Here are some figures about how we are doing on the English forum. We will try to make this kind of report on a monthly basis <a href="http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=46497">in the forum</a> and perhaps quarterly on the blog. </p>
<p>Please remember that the forum is managed by a group of users helping other users for free and on their spare time.</p>
<p>Some basics:</p>
<div class="im"> </p>
<ul>
<li>
The number of posts, members and topics is taken from the phpBB information bottom of main index page</li>
<li>Solved topics are counted in all the forums except admin and archives sections (not visible to standard users)</li>
<li>
Note that the ratio solved topics vs. total topics is slightly biased<br />
since the topics in the archives and admin sections are counted (in<br />
phpBB statistics) but not the solved ones (custom search). However,<br />
there are less than 550 topics there (in more than a 40,000 grand total,<br />
 so less than 1.5%). These last figures shouldn't change very much since<br />
 the private sections are not very active.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here it is (since the solved topics is a new metric, there is only one point for the moment).</p>
<p><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/1e1892cd-d3c5-49ca-a520-f0f0c1630bbb" /> </p>
<p>The blue line (number of posts) is not that important, it just shows that the trend is consistent with the other metrics.&nbsp; The most interesting statistics are the red lines for the members and<br />
the topics (with triangles, giving the time when the figures have been<br />
recorded). Note that the ratio topics vs. members is 0.9 for the English<br />
 forum and above 1.5 for the French and Japanese forums. We tend not to<br />
be too harsh for the rules on the English section and topics are not<br />
often split when different users ask questions (still related of course)<br />
 in the same thread.</p>
<p>Activity has a slightly higher slope during the first 2 years. It may be<br />
 linked to the building of the knowledge database. Once the main issues<br />
and common questions have been discussed, users find their answers more<br />
and more easily with a mere search, hence less topics needed.</p>
<p>
Neither the release of LibreOffice (Oct 2010), nor the move to the ASF<br />
servers (Oct 2011) have changed anything for the activity.</p>
<p>The decrease in the number of members (end of 2011) is linked to the<br />
cleaning of banned users. They had just been banned until now but to<br />
keep only the "real users", their account has been deleted (nearly<br />
1800). This was the first cleaning ever done from the launch of this<br />
forum 4 years ago. 1550 of them had been identified as spammers because<br />
of their post(s). 250 were passive spam (link in signature or interest<br />
field of the profile, without any post).</p>
<p>The ratio of the solved topics is rather good: 14,000 solved (green<br />
triangle) in 41,000 (red triangles), that makes more than 1 in 3 (all<br />
users don't bother to tag their topic as solved).</p>
<p>For the record, last quarter has been in line with the rest: 2100 new<br />
users from Oct 1st to end of this year, meaning 1800 new topics.<br />
As for the spam, we have had 1800 users in 1500 days, it makes 1.21<br />
spammer a day, still rather low, thanks to the registration process<br />
(hard to cheat for bots).</p>
<p>Last figures: 2011 has shown an increase in the max number of online<br />
users along the months. Peak reached 232 beginning of October. The<br />
counter has been reset on Jan 1st 2012 and is already at 214, proving<br />
the audience is still there.</p>
<p>Some words about the team. Let's not forget Terry Ellison who was the<br />
main maintainer of the forum until the move to Apache Software<br />
Foundation servers. His huge involvement has made it possible for both a<br />
 clean running of the forum during 4 years, making it a great place for<br />
those needing/providing help, and contributing to the transfer of the<br />
forum to the ASF servers with a minimal impact for the users.<img class="ajT" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/images/cleardot.gif" /></p>
