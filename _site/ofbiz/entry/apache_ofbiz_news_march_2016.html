<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News March 2016 Welcome to our monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about our first Community Day for 2016, OFBiz at Apachecon NA, an update on the code tidy up and re-factoring work and we congratulate two new ASF members from our community. OFBiz Community Day Last year the project introduced Community Days where we focus on getting as many people as possible from the community to collaborate and work on improving OFBiz. Four Community Days are held each year and our first for 2016 was held on Saturday 19th March. Contributors from around the world participated and collaborated. Countries included France, The Netherlands, India and the Czech Republic and work ranged from bug fixes through to documentation. A total of 39 commits were made to the repository on the Community Day itself although work did span days before and after the event. A Jira Sprint was used to manage the tasks and generate a report for the event. Our next Community Day is planned for Saturday 18th June. Apachecon NA Vancouver 2016 OFBiz will be represented at Apachecon NA in Vancouver. Over the last few years the community has been consistently submitting presentations with the hope of running OFBiz tracks. This time four presentations from the OFBiz community have been selected and cover several topics including community, functional setup and technical development areas. The OFBiz &#39;mini track&#39; is planned for Friday 13th May. Please take a look at the full Apachecon NA schedule for more details. A big thank you to everyone that made a submission. OFBiz Re-Factoring Work has started on some code re-factoring. The overall objective is to tidy up and improve the code base so that it becomes easier to maintain. To help people get started, a list of tasks we&#39;d like to work on has been created. The tasks range from simple straightforward clean up work that anyone can pick up to more complex work that will take a bit more time and effort to complete. We also have a list of general tasks that will also help the clean up effort. The community is looking for people to actively help with this so if you are interested in joining the effort then please take a look at the links below: Re-Factor Approach Current Re-Factor To Do List It is hoped that this work will become part of a continual ongoing effort.

<p>Welcome to our monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about our first Community Day for 2016, OFBiz at Apachecon NA, an update on the code tidy up and re-factoring work and we congratulate two new ASF members from our community.</p>

<h2>OFBiz Community Day</h2>
<p>Last year the project introduced <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/OFBiz+Community+Days">Community Days</a> where we focus on getting as many people as possible from the community to collaborate and work on improving OFBiz.</p>
<p>Four Community Days are held each year and our first for  2016 was held on Saturday 19th March. Contributors from around the world participated and collaborated. Countries included France, The Netherlands, India and the Czech Republic and work ranged from bug fixes through to documentation.</p>
<p>A total of 39 commits were made to the repository on the Community Day itself although work did span days before and after the event. A Jira Sprint was used to manage the tasks and generate a report for the event.</p>
<p>Our next Community Day is planned for Saturday 18th June.</p>
<h2>Apachecon NA Vancouver 2016</h2>
<p>OFBiz will be represented at Apachecon NA in Vancouver. Over the last few years the community has been consistently submitting presentations with the hope of running OFBiz tracks. This time four presentations from the OFBiz community have been selected and cover several topics including community, functional setup and technical development areas. </p>
<p>The OFBiz 'mini track' is planned for Friday 13th May.  Please take a look at the full <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/program/schedule">Apachecon NA schedule</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>OFBiz Re-Factoring</h2>
<p>Work has started on some code re-factoring. The <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Framework+Re-factor">overall objective</a> is to tidy up and improve the code base so that it becomes easier to maintain. </p>
<p>To help people get started, a list of tasks we'd like to work on has been created. The tasks range from simple straightforward clean up work that anyone can pick up to more complex work that will take a bit more time and effort to complete. We also have a list of general tasks that will also help the clean up effort. </p>
<p>The community is looking for people to actively help with this so if you are interested in joining the effort then please take a look at the links below:</p>

<p>It is hoped that this work will become part of a continual ongoing effort.</p>
