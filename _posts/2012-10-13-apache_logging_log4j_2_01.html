<h2>The Apache Logging team is pleased to announce the Apache log4j 2.0-beta2 release!</h2>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the fourth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community.</p>
<h2>Bug fixes and enhancements</h2>
<p>Changes in this version include:</p>
<h3>New features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-35:  Add interval and modulate options to TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy to allow more fine-grained control of<br />
        when file rolling should occur. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-58:  Add support for filtering packages from stack traces. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-84:  If system property "disableThreadContextStack" is set pushes to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If<br />
        system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-83:  If system property "disableThreadContextMap" is set puts to the ThreadContext will be ignored. If<br />
        system property "disableThreadContext" is set both puts and pushes will be ignored. </li>
<li>Add support for ANSI colors by adding the highlight and style pattern converters. Fix pattern<br />
        parsing to allow nested patterns. </li>
<li>Allow the status logging to be directed to stderr or to a file. </li>
<li>Add getFormats to MultiformatMessage and allow StructuredDataMessage to format as XML. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>DefaultConfiguration was not starting the Console Appender.
<li>LOG4J2-92:  Converted DynamicThresholdFilter to use KeyValuePair. Fixed bugs in the Map-based filters<br />
        to allow declaration of multiple values for a key to match the documentation. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-88:  Many logging methods in AbstractLogger were set to an incorrect logging level. catching was<br />
        using the THROWING marker and was set to debug instead of error. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-91:  Log4j 1.2 adapter's Category class was missing 3 log methods. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-84:  If the ThreadContext stack is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of<br />
        creating log events and in the size of the serialized object. Changed the ThreadContext stack to use<br />
        a custom stack interface instead of java.util.Stack as that class is overly heavy. This change will<br />
        cause an API incompatibility. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-83:  If the ThreadContext map is empty the LogEvent will contain a null value to reduce the overhead of creating<br />
        log events and in the size of the serialized object. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-90:  Add documentation on client vs server mode to performance page. </li>
<li>Move variable substitution from PatternLayout to appropriate converters to improve performance. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made ParameterizedMessage, StringFormattedMessage and ThreadDumpMessage immutable. LocalizedMessage is<br />
        immutable except that it will be updated with the logger name when it is added to the LogEvent. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta2 requires a minimum of Java 5 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j12-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>

patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Apache Apache Log4j 2 website:</p>
