High Quality Documentation For some time now there has been discussion around a possible replacement to our current use DocBook for our primary document editor. Sebastien Goasguen started a discussion to look at Markdown by Daring Fireball. With there being concern about how to create and maintain high quality documentation, this is an important thread to participate in for anyone interested in the release documents. After seeing lots of frustrated people with folks I decided to try something out with markdown. I used pandoc to convert some docbook files to markdown and I used a structure for a book based on &#39;The little mongodb&#39; book. We can generate epub and pdf using latex.
