<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News August 2016 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about how statistics show that OFBiz is a typical ASF project, we begin marketing our new OFBiz logo, a new notifications mailing list is setup and our OFBiz Service Providers page gets a clean up. OFBiz - A Typical ASF Project Recently some ASF analytics have been made available using Snoot. One of the most recent factoids that came out this month was about OFBiz. Did you know that OFBiz mimics the focus of all the ASF projects? Yes it it true! Just take a look at the Snoot OFBiz Factoid and you will see that we spend time equally on all of the following: Working on Bug Fixes and Improvements Discussing Developments Interacting with Our Users Committing Code Which goes to show that OFBiz is a truly balanced project! Marketing our New Logo In our last update, we talked about the new OFBiz logo selected by the community. Various versions and formats of the logo have been uploaded to the wiki including a completely white version for use on dark backgrounds. The main logo file is in SVG format which allows it to be resized easily without any loss of quality. You can find all the logo files displayed at the following gallery link: OFBiz Logo Gallery The logos are sorted by date with the newest first. Also remember that some stickers with the new OFBiz logo have been printed, so if you are going to ApacheCon in Seville then please come along to the ASF booth and pick up some stickers! New Notifications Mailing List OFBiz has had so much going on lately (e.g. re-factoring, Gradle, bug fixes etc.) that all the automatic JIRA notifications were filling up our development mailing list. The large volume of messages was making it difficult to follow general discussion threads. To help solve the problem, a new Notifications mailing list has been created and all the automatic JIRA messages have been re-routed to it. This will leave our development mailing clear so that discussion threads can be followed more easily. If you want to follow the JIRA notification messages then you will need to subscribe to the new list at notifications@ofbiz.apache.org. Service Providers A review was done this month to tidy up our OFBiz Service Providers page. Over the years this page had become out of date and contained information that wasn&#39;t necessary. The page has now had a complete cleanup. If you want to be added as a OFBiz Service Provider then details of how to do this are also included on the Service Providers page.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News August 2016 </h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about how statistics show that OFBiz is a typical ASF project, we begin marketing our new OFBiz logo, a new notifications mailing list is setup and our OFBiz Service Providers page gets a clean up.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>OFBiz - A Typical ASF Project</h2>
<p>Recently some ASF analytics have been made available using Snoot. One of the most recent factoids that came out this month was about OFBiz. Did you know that OFBiz mimics the focus of all the ASF projects? </p>
<p>Yes it it true! Just take a look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/snoot_io/status/767063202123354112">Snoot OFBiz Factoid </a> and you will see that we spend time equally on all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on Bug Fixes and Improvements</li>
<li>Discussing Developments</li>
<li>Interacting with Our Users </li>
<li>Committing Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Which goes to show that OFBiz is a truly balanced project!</p>
<h2>Marketing our New Logo</h2>
<p>In our last update, we talked about the new OFBiz logo selected by the community. Various versions and formats of the logo have been uploaded to the wiki including a completely white version for use on dark backgrounds. The main logo file is in SVG format which allows it to be resized easily without any loss of quality. You can find all the logo files displayed at the following gallery link:  <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBADMIN/Material+for+Branding+and+Marketing#MaterialforBrandingandMarketing-Gallery" target="_blank">OFBiz Logo Gallery</a><br />
The logos are sorted by date with the newest first.</p>
<p>Also remember that some stickers with the new OFBiz logo have been printed, so if you are going to ApacheCon in Seville then please come along to the ASF booth and pick up some stickers!</p>
<h2>New Notifications Mailing List</h2>
<p>OFBiz has had so much going on lately (e.g. re-factoring, Gradle, bug fixes etc.) that all the automatic JIRA notifications were filling up our development mailing list. The large volume of messages was making it difficult to follow general discussion threads. To help solve the problem, a new Notifications mailing list has been created and all the automatic JIRA messages have been re-routed to it.  This will leave our development mailing clear so that discussion threads can be followed more easily.</p>
<p>If you want to follow the JIRA notification messages then you will need to subscribe to the new list at notifications@ofbiz.apache.org.</p>
<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>A review was done this month to tidy up our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Apache+OFBiz+Service+Providers">OFBiz Service Providers page</a>. Over the years this page had become out of date and contained information that wasn't necessary. The page has now had a complete cleanup.</p>
<p>If you want to be added as a OFBiz Service Provider then details of how to do this are also included on the Service Providers page.</p>
