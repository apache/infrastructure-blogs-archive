<p>If you are a reader of the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/mail-lists.html">Log4PHP developers list</a>, you probably know it already: We (especially Gavin) managed to get it to build Log4PHP on a regular basis via Apaches Buildbot. Click <a href="http://ci.apache.org/projects/log4php">here</a> to see the latest available website. </p>
<p>The most cool feature is that Gavin managed it to install XDebug on the server. This way we can have regular code coverage reports. With that little piece of software I think we have now a working and quite complete enviroment for future development.</p>
