<div>The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis v1.15.1.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is primarily a bug fix release. &nbsp;It includes an upgrade to Wicket 7.9.0 that fixes a major performance regression in the previous version of Wicket (that Isis 1.15.0 used). &nbsp;It also includes bug fix relating to the Wicket viewer's reference panel with choices, and some other small bug fixes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are also a small number of new features:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>a new Markup value type that allows the Wicket viewer to display arbitrary HTML</li>
<li>a new "layout" URL for the Restful Objects viewer</li>
<li>a new "logout" page for the Wicket viewer to support monitoring tools.</li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2].</div>
<div>Alternatively, download the release and build it from source [3].</div>
<div></div>
<div>Enjoy!</div>
