<p>
Technical Tracks: Call For Participation</bold><br>
<em>All submissions must be received by Friday, 28 May 2010 at midnight Pacific Time</em>.<br>
<p>
<p>
The official conference, trainings, and expo of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) returns to Atlanta this November, with dozens of technical, business, and community-focused sessions at the beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. 
<p>
Over the past decade, the ASF has gone from strength to strength, developing and shepherding nearly 150 Top-Level Projects and new initiatives in the Apache Incubator and Labs. This year's ApacheCon celebrates how Apache technologies have sparked creativity, challenged processes, streamlined development, improved collaboration, launched businesses, bolstered economies, and improved lives.
<p>
We are proud of our achievements and recognize that the global Apache community --both developers and users-- are responsible for the success and popularity of our products.
<p>
The ApacheCon Planning Team are soliciting 50-minute technical presentations for the next conference, which will focus on the theme “Servers, the Cloud, and Innovation”.
<p>
We are particularly interested in highly-relevant, professionally-directed presentations that demonstrate specific probrlems and real-world solutions. Part of the technical program has already been planned; we welcome proposals based on the following Apache Projects and related technical areas:
<p>
- Cassandra/NoSQL<br>
- Content Technologies<br>
- (Java) Enterprise Development<br>
- Felix/OSGi<br>
- Geronimo<br>
- Hadoop + friends/Cloud Computing<br>
- Lucene, Mahout + friends/Search<br>
- Tomcat<br>
- Tuscany<br>
<p>
<p>
Submissions are open to anyone with relevant expertise: <em><bold>ASF affiliation is not required to present at, attend, or otherwise participate in ApacheCon</bold></em>.
<p>
Please keep in mind that whilst we encourage submissions that the highlight the use of specific Apache solutions, we are unable to accept marketing/commercially-oriented presentations.
<p>
Other proposals, such as panels, or those longer than 50 minutes in duration have been considered in the past. You are welcome to submit an alternate presentation, however, such sessions are accepted under exceptional circumstances. Please be as descriptive as possible, including names/bios of proposed panelists and any related details.
<p>
All accepted speakers (not co-presenters) qualify for general conference admission and a minimum of two nights lodging at the conference hotel. Additional hotel nights and travel assistance are possible, depending on the number of presentations given and type of assistance needed.
