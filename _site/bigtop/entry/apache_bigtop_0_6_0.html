<meta name="description" content="Just in time for Hadoop Summit 2013, Apache Bigtop team is very pleased to announce the release of Apache Bigtop 0.6.0. The very first release of a fully integrated Big data management distribution built on the currently most advanced Hadoop 2.x -- Hadoop 2.0.5-alpha. Apache Bigtop, as many of you might already know, is a project aimed at creating 100% open source and community driven Big data management distribution based on Apache Hadoop. You can learn more about it by reading one of our earlier blog posts on Apache Blogs. The very astute readers of this blog would notice that given our quarterly release schedule Bigtop 0.6.0 should have been called Bigtop 0.7.0. It is true that we skipped a quarter. Our excuse is that we spent all this extra time on helping Hadoop community stabilize the Hadoop 2.x code line and making it a robust kernel for all the applications that are now part of the Bigtop distribution. And speaking of applications, we haven&rsquo;t forgotten to grow the Bigtop family. Bigtop 0.6.0 adds Apache HCatalog and Apache Giraph to the mix. The full list of Hadoop applications available as part of Bigtop 0.6.0 release is now: Apache Zookeeper 3.4.5Apache Flume 1.3.1 Apache HBase 0.94.5 Apache Pig 0.11.1 Apache Hive 0.10.0 Apache Sqoop 2 (AKA 1.99.2) Apache Oozie 3.3.2 Apache Whirr 0.8.2 Apache Mahout 0.7 Apache Solr (SolrCloud) 4.2.1 Apache Crunch (incubating) 0.5.0 Apache HCatalog 0.5.0 Apache Giraph 1.0.0 LinkedIn DataFu 0.0.6 Cloudera Hue 2.3.0 The list of supported Linux platforms has expanded to include: CentOS/RHEL 5 and 6 Fedora 17 and 18 SuSE Linux Enterprise 11 OpenSUSE 12.2 Ubuntu LTS Lucid (10.04) and Precise (12.04) Ubuntu Quantal (12.10) We would like to invite everybody to give the Bigtop 0.6.0 binary distribution a try. All you have to do is to pick your favorite Linux distribution, follow our wiki instructions and you will have your first pseudo-distributed cluster computing Pi in no time. If you&rsquo;re thinking about deploying Bigtop to a fully-distributed cluster you might find our Puppet code to be useful &mdash; after all we use it all the time ourselves to test Bigtop. There is brief documentation on how to run our Puppet recipes in a master-less puppet configuration, but a typical Puppet master setup should work as well. Bigtop plays an important role in CDH which leverages all its packaging code from Bigtop. Finally, Apache Bigtop would not have been possible without the tireless work of all the volunteer developers. This is an amazing community to be part of, and if you would like to join us, now is the time. In fact, we decided to take advantage of Hadoop Summit drawing a lot of Hadoop developers to the San Francisco Bay Area and have our first meeting of the Apache Bigtop Working Group on Thu, Jun 27 2013. Come join us! It is a lot of fun to build the future of bigdata management together! Happy Big Data discoveries,Your faithful and tireless Bigtop development team!" />

 would like to invite everybody to give the Bigtop 0.6.0 binary<br />
distribution a try. All you have to do is to pick your favorite Linux<br />
distribution, follow our </span><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+install+Hadoop+distribution+from+Bigtop+0.6.0"><span style="font-family: Arial; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0392b2;"><b>wiki instructions</b></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;"> and you will have your first pseudo-distributed cluster computing Pi in no time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.425; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 9pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;">If<br />
 you&rsquo;re thinking about deploying Bigtop to a fully-distributed cluster<br />
you might find our Puppet code to be useful &mdash; after all we use it all<br />
the time ourselves to test Bigtop. There is </span><a href="https://github.com/apache/bigtop/tree/master/bigtop-deploy/puppet"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0392b2; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">brief documentation</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;"><br />
 on how to run our Puppet recipes in a master-less puppet configuration,<br />
 but a typical Puppet master setup should work as well. Bigtop plays an<br />
important role in CDH which leverages all its packaging code from<br />
Bigtop.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.425; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 9pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;">Finally,<br />
 Apache Bigtop would not have been possible without the tireless work of<br />
 all the volunteer developers. This is an amazing community to be part<br />
of, and if you would like to join us, now is the time. In fact, we<br />
decided to take advantage of Hadoop Summit drawing a lot of Hadoop<br />
developers to the San Francisco Bay Area and have our first meeting of<br />
the </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/events/122050632/"><span style="font-family: Arial; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0392b2;"><b>Apache Bigtop Working Group on Thu, Jun 27 2013</b></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;">. Come join us! It is a lot of fun to build the future of bigdata management together!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #505050; vertical-align: baseline;">Happy Big Data discoveries,<br class="kix-line-break" />Your faithful and tireless Bigtop development team!</span></p>
