Providing an Open Source, component-oriented development model for Web application development, Wicket eases the creation and maintenance of complex Java Web applications; v6.0 enhances core functionality and offers many new features, from OSGi compatibility to AJAX attributes to Big Data support.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &quot;This release delivers a reinvigorated implementation of our client side API that enables developers to integrate rich JavaScript libraries and components with minimal effort.
