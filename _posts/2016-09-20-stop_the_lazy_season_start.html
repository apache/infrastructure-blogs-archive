title: Stop the lazy season, start changing
excerpt: "<p> </p> \r\n  <p><img alt=\"Keep calm and embrace change\" src=\"https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/2fcc9c46-f834-44d6-8873-a64fbf6b203b\"
  /> </p> \r\n  <p>It's time to write about new things that happen here in the Apache
  OpenOffice project.</p> \r\n  <p>At first, we want to let you know about new releases.
  The first \r\nwill be the bugfix release 4.1.3 that will tie in directly with the
  \r\ncurrent version. It's already in the cooking pot but needs some tasing \r\nand
  refinement before we will serve it. The next will then be the \r\nfollow-up release
  4.1.4 with further fixes.</p> \r\n  <p>When you now think <i>&quot;hm, only fixed
  bugs? Nice, but what about more?&quot;</i>\r\n then please be patient. We are also
  planning a release afterwards with \r\nmore changes. As these are not finally certain
  - number as well as size -\r\n even the version number is not yet written in stone.</p>
  \r\n  <p>More news will follow. But this needs further blog posts.\r\n</p>"

<p>It's time to write about new things that happen here in the Apache OpenOffice project.</p>

<p>When you now think <i>"hm, only fixed bugs? Nice, but what about more"</i> then please be patient. We are also planning a release afterwards with many more changes, including all new features developed in the last couple of years. As these aren't finally certain - number as well as size - even the version number isn't yet written in stone.</p>
<p>More news will follow. But this needs further blog posts.</p>
