<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News September 2017 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about another documentation effort but this time it is around our existing Data Model, we continue to tidy up our new website, we discuss the possibility of adding bitcoin support to OFBiz and we take a look at some of our Twitter statistics. Updated OFBiz Data Model Book Recently we have been looking at ways to improve our documentation and it has been a focus of the project and over the last month and contributors in our community are working hard to update our review and update our existing documentation. Many of you may already know about the OFBiz Data Model diagrams that were put together by David E. Jones. Over time OFBiz has changed, so we have had to make adjustments and improvements to the original Data Model. Last week Aditya Sharma announced an updated version of the OFBiz Data Model that has been published on our wiki. Details can be found at the link below: Big Book for Apache OFBiz Data Model 2017 The main key changes are as follows: Colored content with titles according to the internal color pattern. Added a separate page for integration specific entities. Removed technical process diagrams, making it specific for entities. Added 77 new entities. Removed 8 entities. Added around 200+ new fields in entities (Though major portion includes the addition of description or attrDescription fields in *Attribute or *TypeAttr entities).&lt;/l&gt; Removed 24 fields. &lt;/ul&gt; This is a great resource for anyone wanting to understand the OFBiz Data Model and its relationships. A big thank you to Aditya Sharma, Sonal Patwari and everyone who contributed to this effort. Ongoing Website Improvements Last month we told you about our new website going live. Over the last few weeks, we have continued to do some minor corrections and other small tasks associated with tidying up the site. We hope that the community is finding the new site useful and easy to navigate.Thanks very much to everyone who is helping out with these tasks especially Jacques Le Roux. Also contributors from our French community are keen to promote OFBiz in France and have proposed ways to make the content from our website available in French. Work is already in progress around this and a Jira has been created with the details. Our next step will be to put together our plans to continue to improve the site and information. Adding Bitcoin Support in OFBiz One of the discussions raised this month was regarding a proposal to add Bitcoin support to OFBiz. Details of the thread can be found below: Bitcoin Discussion As feedback was very positive and a Jira Ticket has been created which is to be used to monitor the progress of adding and testing this new feature. Thanks very much to Julian Smith for the proposal and the offer to provide a patch for this functionality. We look forward to seeing the results. Apache OFBiz on Twitter The project has been using its Twitter account to promote OFBiz and its features, community and the ASF. Currently, we have made over 1700 tweets and have 469 followers. Over the last month, our tweets are gained over 2000 impressions which means that we are successfully spreading the word.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News September 2017 </h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about another documentation effort but this time it is around our existing Data Model, we continue to tidy up our new website, we discuss the possibility of adding bitcoin support to OFBiz and we take a look at some of our Twitter statistics.<br />
<!--more--> </p>
<h2>Updated OFBiz Data Model Book</h2>
<p>Recently we have been looking at ways to improve our documentation and it has been a focus of the project and over the last month and contributors in our community are working hard to update our review and update our existing documentation. Many of you may already know about the OFBiz Data Model diagrams that were put together by David E. Jones. Over time OFBiz has changed, so we have had to make adjustments and improvements to the original Data Model. </p>
<p>Last week Aditya Sharma announced an updated version of the OFBiz Data Model  that has been published on our wiki. Details can be found at the link below:<br />
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Data+Model+Diagrams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Big Book for Apache OFBiz Data Model 2017</a></p>
<p>The main key changes are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li> Colored content with titles according to the internal color pattern.</li>
<li>  Added a separate page for integration specific entities.</li>
<li> Removed technical process diagrams, making it specific for entities.</li>
<li> Added 77 new entities.</li>
<li>   Removed 8 entities.</li>
<li> Added around 200+ new fields in entities (Though major portion includes the addition of description or attrDescription fields in *Attribute or *TypeAttr entities).</l>
<li>Removed 24 fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great resource for anyone wanting to understand the OFBiz Data Model and its relationships. A big thank you to Aditya Sharma, Sonal Patwari and everyone who contributed to this effort.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Website Improvements</h2>
<p>Last month we told you about our new website going live. Over the last few weeks, we have continued to do some minor corrections and other small tasks associated with tidying up the site. We hope that the community is finding the new site useful and easy to navigate.Thanks very much to everyone who is helping out with these tasks especially Jacques Le Roux.</p>
<p>Also contributors from our French community are keen to promote OFBiz in France and have proposed ways to make the content from our website available in French. Work is already in progress around this and a Jira has been created with the details.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to put together our plans to continue to improve the site and information. </p>
<h2>Adding Bitcoin Support in OFBiz</h2>
<p>One of the discussions raised this month was regarding a proposal to add Bitcoin support to OFBiz. Details of the thread can be found below:<br />
 <a href="https://s.apache.org/UgKF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Bitcoin Discussion</a><br />
As feedback was very positive and a  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-9699" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jira Ticket</a> has been created which is to be used to monitor the progress of adding and testing this new feature.</p>
<p>Thanks very much to Julian Smith for the proposal and the offer to provide a patch for this functionality. We look forward to seeing the results.</p>
