<a href="http://www.osgi.org/DevCon2010/HomePage" title="OSGi DevCon US">OSGi DevCon US</a>, which is co-located with <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/" title="EclipseCon US">EclipseCon US</a>, is less than two weeks away.  I'm down to do a short talk on Monday 22nd entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/sessions/?page=sessions&amp;id=1290" title="Apache Aries: Enterprise OSGi in Action">Apache Aries: Enterprise OSGi in Action</a>&quot;.  I'm going to give an overview of the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/aries/" title="Apache Aries">Apache Aries</a> project and then give a demo or two of a few of the components (demo-gremlins permitting ;-) ).  Aries has come such a long way in just 6 months and there are so many things to cram into a 25 minute session, that it's going to be difficult to know what to leave out!

Glyn Normington (the lead on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/virgo/" title="Eclipse Virgo">Eclipse Virgo</a> project) and I have also proposed a joint BoF on &quot;<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/submissions/2010/view_talk.php?id=1585" title="Application Models for OSGi">Application Models for OSGi</a>&quot;.  This is an area we're evolving in Aries and is also being actively discussed for standardization in the <a title="OSGi Alliance" href="http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage">OSGi Alliance</a>.  If the BoF is accepted, our hope is to get valuable input from folks wishing to shape the direction of OSGi application models.

If you're interested in learning more about <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/aries/" title="Apache Aries">Apache Aries</a>, or want to help shape the future of Enterprise OSGi applications, come along to the sessions, and feel free to corner me for a chat.
