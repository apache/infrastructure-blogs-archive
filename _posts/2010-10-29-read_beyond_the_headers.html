  content: "Ok, so I've read beyond the header, this is the next line:\r\npackage
    org.apache.harmony.security.tests.support.cert;\r\n\r\nTo me that says it is part

    unreasonably) concluded that PolicyNodeImpl.java must be part of Apache Harmony.\r\n\r\nAnd
    other did not know any details but copied the false conclusions."

  content: "If I create a class and put it on a package path that one of your libraries
    uses, does that make it part of your library?\r\n\r\nFunctionally, for me it would
    be part of your library, in that it can make use of protected resources found
    there.  But in no way does code that I write implicate you in anything that the
    code does.\r\n\r\n"

<p>
Recent reports on various blogs have attributed to the ASF a number of<br />
the source files identified by Oracle as ones that they believe<br />
infringe on their copyrights.  The code in question has an header that<br />
mentions Apache, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  The<br />
code itself is using a license that is named after our foundation, is<br />
in fact the license that we ourselves use.  Many others use it too, as<br />
the license was explicitly designed to allow such uses.</p>
<p>
Even though the code in question has an Apache license, it is not part of<br />
Harmony. PolicyNodeImpl.java is simply not a Harmony class.</p>
<p>Verifying that something is from the Apache Software Foundation is<br />
very easy to do: our sources are all posted online. So it is<br />
sad when people don't take that step.</p></p>
