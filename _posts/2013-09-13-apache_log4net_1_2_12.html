<p>The Apache log4net team is pleased to announce the release of Apache<br />
log4net 1.2.12.  The release is available for download at</p>

<p>The Apache log4net library is a tool to help the programmer output log<br />
statements to a variety of output targets.  log4net is a port of the<br />
excellent Apache log4j framework to the Microsoft(R) .NET runtime.</p>
<p>log4net 1.2.12 is mostly a bugfix release in which more than thirty JIRA<br />
issues have been resolved.  See</p>

<p>The binary distributions no longer contain assemblies built for the<br />

distribution.</p>

location when downloading the release.</p>
