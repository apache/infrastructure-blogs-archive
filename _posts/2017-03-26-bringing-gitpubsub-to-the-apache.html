<p>
When it comes to <a href="#Jenkins">[Jenkins</a>], it has long been known that [polling must die].</p>
<p>While we could go and create post commit hooks in all the ASF hosted Git repositories, that is something that realistically is just creating an added maintenance burden.</p>
<p>In any case, we have [GitPubSub]. </p>
<p>The question then becomes, how do we integrate [GitPubSub] with [Jenkins]?</p>
<p>Thankfully, ASF committer stephenc is also an active committer to the [Jenkins] project and created a [plugin] that connects to [GitPubSub] parses the events and passes them through to the Jenkins [SCM API].</p>
<p>
What does this mean?</p>
<p>* You can turn your Git polling down - way way down - to something like once per day.<br />
This should significantly reduce the load on both the ASF git servers and builds.apache.org<br />* Your builds will be triggered in seconds rather than having to wait for the next polling run.<br />* You can try out using Multi-branch projects much like the [Maven] project has been doing for [Maven core] and [Maven Surefire]</p>
<p>
If the reaction to this change proves positive, the next step will be to integrate SvnPubSub with Jenkins and bring the benefits to the Subversion based projects too</p></p>
