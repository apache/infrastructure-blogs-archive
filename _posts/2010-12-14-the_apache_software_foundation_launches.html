<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><i><b>Google-hosted site provides a<br />
&ldquo;home-away-from-home&rdquo; for code associated with Apache projects</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 14 December 2010<br />
&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) today announced<br />
<a href="http://apache-extras.org">apache-extras.org</a>, the Google-hosted site for code associated with<br />
Apache projects that are not part of the Foundation's more than<br />
eighty Top-level Projects and dozens of initiatives in the Apache<br />
Incubator and Labs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">"The Apache Software Foundation<br />
has a long history of software innovation through collaboration; the<br />
larger the pool of potential contributors the more innovation we<br />
see," said Ross Gardler, ASF Vice President of Community<br />
Development. "Apache Extras provides a home for Apache related<br />
software which is not formally a part of the ASF itself. Having these<br />
projects on a single hosting platform will help to further accelerate<br />
innovation involving Apache software."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Among the ASF's strengths are its<br />
well-established requirements relating to intellectual property<br />
management, license use, and community management. Apache-extras.org<br />
provides a home for projects that are unable to, or do not wish to,<br />
conform to those rules yet still want to signal their relationship to<br />
official Apache projects.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As projects on the new Google-hosted<br />
service will not be managed by The Apache Software Foundation,<br />
participants are allowed to use whatever license and project<br />
management process they desire. <a href="http://www.apache-extras.org">Apache-extras.org</a> will provide a<br />
level of visibility for these projects that is unavailable on other<br />
code-hosting forges.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Existing Google Code projects related<br />
to Apache products can be easily migrated to the new<br />
apache-extras.org site, whilst those involved with new Apache-related<br />
projects can start quickly by filling out a simple form. The ASF<br />
Community Development team will work directly with Apache Extras to<br />
ensure innovation around Apache projects is accelerated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Technical queries regarding the ASF's<br />
relationship with apache-extras.org can be directed to the ASF<br />
Community Development team at dev@community.apache.org. For<br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>About The Apache Software Foundation<br />
(ASF)</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Established in 1999, the all-volunteer<br />
Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source<br />
projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world's most popular<br />
Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as<br />
"The Apache Way," more than 300 individual Members and<br />
2,500 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available<br />
enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide:<br />
thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache<br />
License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing<br />
lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's<br />
official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is funded by<br />
individual donations and corporate sponsors including AMD, Basis<br />
Technology, Facebook, Google, IBM, HP, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft,<br />
SpringSource/VMware, and Yahoo!. For more information, visit<br />
