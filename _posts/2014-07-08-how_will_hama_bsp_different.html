  content: Thank you for the reply. I hope you get more community support because
    Hama can be a core compontent of many solutions...

<p><b>Firstly, why did we use HBase?</b></p>
<p>Until last year, we tried to implement the distributed matrix/graph computing algorithms based on Map/Reduce.</p>
<p>As you know, the Hadoop is consists of HDFS, which is designed for commodity servers as a shared nothing model (also termed as data partitioning model), and a distributed programming model called Map/Reduce. The Map/Reduce is a high-performance parallel data processing engine, to be sure, but it's not good for complex numerical/relational processing requires huge iterations or inter-node communications. So, we used HBase as a shared storage (shared memory model).</p>
<p><b>Why BSP instead of Map/Reduce and HBase?</b></p>
<p>However, there were still problems as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS overhead of running shared storage software (HBase)</li>
<li>The limitation of HBase faculty (especially, a size of column qualifier)</li>
<li>Growth of code complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we started to consider about message-passing model, and decided to adopt the BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) model, inspired by Pregel from Google Research Blog.</p>
<p><b>What's the Pregel?</b></p>

<p>According to my understanding, Pregel is graph-specific: a large-scale graph computing framework, based on BSP model. </p>
<p><b>How will Hama BSP different from Pregel?</b></p>
<p>Hama BSP is a computing engine, based on BSP model, like a Pregel, and it'll be compatible with existing HDFS cluster, or any FileSystem and Database in the future. However, we believe that the BSP computing model is not limited to a problems of graph; it can be used for widely distributed software such as Map/Reduce. In addition to a field of graph, there are many other algorithms, which have similar problems with graph processing using Map/Reduce. Actually, the BSP model has been researched for many years in the field of matrix computation, too.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're trying to implement more generalized BSP computing solution. And, the Hama will consists of the BSP computing engine, and a set of few examples (e.g., matrix inversion, pagerank, BFS, ..., etc). </p>
