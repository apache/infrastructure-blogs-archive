<p>Tiles 2.1.3 is available for <a href="http://tiles.apache.org/download.html">download</a>. This version is essentially a bugfix release, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>it works better in an OSGi environment, see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/TILES-404">TILES-404</a>;</li>
<li>some annoyances with <a href="https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/TILES-365">list attribute inheritance</a> and with <a href="https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/TILES-429">attributes not copied</a> have been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that this will be the last release of the 2.1.x branch, to concentrate on 2.2.0.</p>
