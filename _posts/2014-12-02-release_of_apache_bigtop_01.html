  content: "Thanks cos !  A couple of other new features to note. . . \r\n\r\nTrying
    bigtop: the super easy vagrant recipes we now have which allow you to try out
    bigtop on VMs (vbox) or Docker containers.  These are now configurable by a single
    YAML file, under the bigtop-deploy/vm/ ( vagrant-puppet and docker-puppet directories
    ).\r\n\r\nBlueprints: BigPetStore as you mentioned is upgraded and includes a
    mapreduce as well as a spark implementation, which uses our new data generator
    algorithm for extremely realistic time series data.\r\n\r\nSmoke tests: The new
    smoke tests which run from zero, no gradle, or maven, or anything else required,
    and can be used to validate a hadoop ecosystem on any cluster very easily and
    quickly."
