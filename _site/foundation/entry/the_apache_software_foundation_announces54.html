<meta name="description" content="Open Source, generic Java client and server library implementation of the OData (Open Data Protocol) standard for interoperable querying and sharing of data across applications in enterprise, Cloud, and mobile environments Forest Hill, MD &ndash;07 April 2014&ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 170 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&trade; Olingo&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. &lt;/p&gt; &quot;We are pleased to graduate from the Apache Incubator,&quot; said Stephan Klevenz, Vice President of Apache Olingo. &quot;The Apache Way of collaborative software development shows that it is possible to produce high-quality and faithful implementations of standards.&quot; Klevenz is also a development architect at SAP and an Apache committer since 2010. Apache Olingo provides generic Java and JavaScript libraries that implement the Open Data Protocol (OData), the standardized data access protocol used for creating and consuming data APIs in an interoperable manner across applications and devices. OData provides a uniform way to expose full-featured data APIs by building on core protocols such as HTTP as well as commonly accepted methodologies such as REST.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of OData 2.0, and will serve as a code base for OData 4.0, the OASIS standard of the protocol (OASIS OData TC). The OASIS international open standards consortium recently announced that Open Data Protocol (OData) version 4.0 and OData JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Format version 4.0 have been approved as OASIS Standards. These REST-based standards simplify the querying, sharing, and consuming of data across applications for re-use in enterprise, Cloud, and mobile environments. More information on the OData ecosystem of open data producer and consumer services is available at http://www.OData.org/ Olingo is used by browser-based user interfaces to query data residing on servers. It is also used to synchronize data to mobile devices, and exchange data between server systems, and is part of the technical foundation of SAP NetWeaver&reg; Gateway technology, among other enterprise solutions. &lt;/p&gt; Olingo entered the Apache Incubator in July 2013, seeded by code from SAP (Java server libraries for OData 2.0) and Microsoft Open Technologies (Java client libraries for OData 3.0 and JavaScript libraries for OData 3.0). The project has since undergone three releases, reflecting 495,107 lines of code and 1,102 commits by 20 individual contributors. Apache Olingo supports multiple languages, including Java and JavaScript for OData clients and servers, namely OData 2.0 in Java, OData 4.0 in Java, and OData 4.0 in JavaScript. Olingo extensions contain additional features, such as the support of Java Persistence API (JPA) or annotated bean classes. The project&#39;s documentation, wiki, and tutorials highlight several examples of implementing a custom OData service, including a sample Web application built with Apache Maven that can be deployed to any Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (JEE)-compliant Web application server, such as Apache Tomcat. &quot;OData v4 recently became an OASIS standard that is increasingly opening up data for an open Web,&quot; said Eduard Koller, Senior Program Manager at Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. &quot;Apache Olingo is open source software to aid in the production of OData v4.0 clients and servers in both Java and JavaScript. The project brings together several companies and community developers and we look forward to welcoming more users and contributors to the community.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; Availability and OversightAs with all Apache products, Apache Olingo software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&#39;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.
