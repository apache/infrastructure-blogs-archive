<p>The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.6.2 release!</p>
<p>
Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade<br />
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,<br />
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous<br />
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating<br />
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.</p>
<p>
This is the twelfth GA release. It is primarily a bugfix release. More details on the<br />
fixes are itemized below.</p>
<p>
Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the<br />
addition of new methods to the Logger interface. If you have code that does:</p>
<p><tt>logger.error(null, &ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.<br />
To correct this either do:</p>
<p><tt>logger.error(&ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>
or</p>
<p><tt>logger.error((Marker) null, &ldquo;This is the log message&rdquo;, throwable);</tt></p>
<p>Log4j 2.6.2 maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.</p>
<p><h2>GA Release 2.6.2</h2>
<p>
Changes in this version include:</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li> LOG4J2-1395:  Add "direct" option to ConsoleAppender for increased performance.
<li> LOG4J2-1437:  (GC) ObjectMessage and ReusableObjectMessage now avoid calling toString() on auto-boxed primitive parameters.
<li> LOG4J2-1415:  (GC) ParameterFormatter now avoids calling toString() on auto-boxed primitive message parameters.
<li> LOG4J2-1412:  Unbox utility's ringbuffer of StringBuilders is now configurable.
</ul>
<p>Fixed Bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li> LOG4J2-904:  If copy and delete fails in rename action then resort to truncating the source file after copying it. Thanks to Bernhard M&auml;hr.
<li> LOG4J2-1250:  CronTriggeringPolicy was not properly setting the prevFileTime value for the PatternProcessor so<br />
        file dates and times on rolled files were incorrect. </p>
<li> LOG4J2-1452:  Fixed issue where reusable messages broke flow tracing logic. Thanks to Mikael St&aring;ldal.
<li> LOG4J2-1440:  Fix bug in OnStartupTriggeringPolicy that allowed it to roll over on every reconfiguration. Added<br />
        minSize attribute. </p>
<li> LOG4J2-1414:  Fixed minor issues with the 2.6.1 web site. Thanks to Ralph Goers.
<li> LOG4J2-1434:  Ensure that the thread-local StringBuilders used by Layouts to format log events to text will not<br />
        retain excessive memory after a large message was logged. Thanks to Luke Butters. </p>
<li> LOG4J2-1418:  Provide MessageFactory2 to custom Logger implementations.
<li> LOG4J2-1420:  RollingRandomAccessFileManager was not properly rolling over on startup and was getting a NullPointerException.
<li> LOG4J2-1417:  Fixed issue where Unbox utility ignored the value Constants.ENABLE_THREADLOCALS and always stored non-JDK classes in ThreadLocals.
<li> LOG4J2-1422:  Fixed issue where AsyncAppenderQueueFullPolicyTest sometimes hangs.
<li> LOG4J2-1445:  OnStartupTriggeringPolicyTest fails on Windows saying the file is used by another process. Thanks to Ludovic HOCHET.
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li> LOG4J2-1432:  Update Jackson from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5.
<li> LOG4J2-1433:  Update Jansi from 1.11 to 1.13.
<li> LOG4J2-1444:  Update Apache Commons Compress from 1.11 to 1.12.
</ul>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.6.2 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the last release that<br />
supported Java 6.</p>
<p>Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>

patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Apache Apache Log4j 2 website:</p>
