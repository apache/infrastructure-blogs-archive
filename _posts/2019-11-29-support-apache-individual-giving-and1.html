<p><strong><em>Your support helps The Apache Software Foundation &mdash;the world's largest Open Source foundation&mdash; to continue to <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-celebrates1">provide $20B+ worth of software for the public good at 100% no cost</a>.</em></strong> </p></p>
<div>
<p>As the US Thanksgiving holidays are upon us, our end-of-year Individual Giving and Corporate Gifts campaigns have begun. Your support of The Apache Software Foundation helps ensure 350+ Apache projects and initiatives remain accessible to all, absolutely free of charge.</p>
<p>Support from donors enables the all-volunteer, vendor-neutral ASF ensure its community-driven projects are freely available to billions of users, to steward, develop, and advance the next generation of Open Source innovations "The Apache Way", and nuture diverse communities around the globe.</p>
<p>This Tuesday, 3 December, is <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a> &mdash;the global fundraising movement that launched the second largest giving day of the year. When you donate to the ASF on Giving Tuesday itself, you can be a part of something even bigger: in 2018 more than $400M was raised for hundreds of organizations worldwide.</p>
