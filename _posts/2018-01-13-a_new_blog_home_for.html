<p>
As part of our recent new release of Apache JSPWiki 2.10.2, we&rsquo;re pleased to announce that the JSPWiki project has a brand new blog home&mdash;right here on <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki" target="_blank" title="JSPWiki blog homepage">https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki</a>. Over the coming weeks we&rsquo;ll be sharing news, tips, and feature highlights&mdash;so be sure to check back regularly. The RSS feed for your favourite news reader is <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki/feed/entries/atom" title="JSPWiki blog RSS feed" target="_blank">here</a> (and for folks who prefer social networks, we have a revived presence on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheJSPWiki" title="JSPWiki on Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jspwiki" title="JSPWiki on Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>For JSPWiki 2.10.2, you can check out the list of terrific new features <a href="https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=NewIn2.10" title="New features in JSPWiki 2.10.2" target="_blank">here</a>. As well as code rewrites for core components, support for running in Docker containers, and fixes for popular supporting application servers, the new <a href="https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Haddock%20Template" title="Link to the Haddock template documentation" target="_blank">Haddock</a> template has been enabled by default. Previously only available as a manually configured option, Haddock has matured sufficiently to serve as our production-ready, next-generation template. There&rsquo;s a huge number of improvements in Haddock compared with JSPWiki&rsquo;s legacy templates, and we&rsquo;ll be covering some highlights in future blog posts. If your site is running an older JSPWiki version, consider giving it a substantial visual and feature boost by updating to 2.10.2.</p>

We have one of the most friendly and helpful user and developer communities around&mdash;folks as always are welcome and encouraged to participate via the <a href="https://jspwiki.apache.org/community/mailing_lists.html" title="Link to the JSPWiki mailing lists" target="_blank">mailing lists</a>.</p>
