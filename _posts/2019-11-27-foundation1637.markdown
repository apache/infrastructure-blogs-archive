      <p>As the US Thanksgiving holidays are upon us, our end-of-year Individual Giving and Corporate Gifts campaigns have begun. Your support of The Apache Software Foundation helps ensure 350+ Apache projects and initiatives remain accessible to all, absolutely free of charge.</p> 
      <p>Support from donors enables the all-volunteer, vendor-neutral ASF ensure its community-driven projects are freely available to billions of users, to steward, develop, and advance the next generation of Open Source innovations &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, and nuture diverse communities around the globe.</p> 
      <p>This Tuesday, 3 December, is <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a> —the global fundraising movement that launched the second largest giving day of the year. When you donate to the ASF on Giving Tuesday itself, you can be a part of something even bigger: in 2018 more than $400M was raised for hundreds of organizations worldwide.</p>
