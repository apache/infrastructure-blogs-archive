<p>
    Hi all. Today, we will briefly show you about PHP7.4 support which will be available in the <b>next NetBeans version</b> i.e. <b>NetBeans 11.2</b>.</p>
<p>
    First of all, I strongly hope that new features are tested by PHP users before NetBeans 11.2 is released because there should be bugs.<br />
    Definitely, we need your help!</p>
<p>    If you are interested in them, please test it. You can download a dev version <a href="https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/NetBeans/job/netbeans-linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/">here</a>.</p>
<p>    Then, we could merge new changes quickly thanks to our committer <b>Tomas Mysik</b>. Thanks a lot for your review, Tomas!</p>
<h3>PHP 7.4 Support</h3>
<p>
    To enable it, you have to set PHP 7.4 as the PHP version of your PHP project. (Right-click your project node, click Project Properties.)</p>

<p>
    NetBeans provides support for the new syntaxes for PHP 7.4.</p>
<h4>Null Coalescing Assignment Operator</h4>

<h4>Typed Properties 2.0</h4>
<p><img src="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/120737486/nb112-php74-typed-properties-2.0.png"/></p>
<h4>Arrow Functions 2.0</h4>

<h3>New Hints</h3>
<h4>Suggestion for converting a simple closure to an arrow function</h4>

<h4>Suggestion for using combined assignment operators</h4>

<p>
    Of course, code completion, formatting, go to declaration, and mark occurrence features for the above syntaxes should also be fixed.</p>
<p>
    That's all for today. As always, please test it. You can download a development version from<br />
    <a href="https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/NetBeans/job/netbeans-linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/">Jenkins Build</a>.<br />
