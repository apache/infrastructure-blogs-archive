excerpt: "The Apache Flex project, the all-volunteer group of developers, and stakeholders
  in the development framework, today announced the release of Apache Flex 4.11.0.
  This release makes some important improvements over previous versions of Apache
  Flex and Adobe Flex. \r\n\r\nThe Apache Flex 4.11.0 SDK allows application developers
  to build expressive web and mobile applications using MXML for layout and ActionScript
  3, an ECMAScript based language for client-side scripting.\r\n\r\nThe Apache Flex
  4.11.0 release contains many improvements that professional software development
  teams will appreciate. This advances the framework forward. It is truly one of the
  best cross-platform programming languages used to write applications that are testable
  and can be compiled to run on multiple technology platforms from a single set of
  code."

  content: "Carlos,  WinRT support will have to come from Adobe, not us. The Adobe
    AIR platform would be the one that provides this support.  The Flash Player is
    included in Metro IE, and the Flash Plugin is whitelisted -- so you can create
    Flex application that target RT that way.\r\n\r\nSantosh,  It looks like it is!
    \ You can check the release notes to see what bugs have been closed with this
    release."
