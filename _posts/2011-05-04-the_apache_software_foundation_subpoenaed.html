  content: "\r\nI always thought that going Java was a bad idea for Apache.\r\n\r\nI'd
    prefer to steer free of owned languages and develop with C/C++, Go and the like.\r\n\r\nJava
    was a 15 year misadventure into troubleland.\r\n\r\n"

  content: "\r\nTotally off-topic, but this is the Apache Foundation. Your biggest
    project runs over 60% of all webservers.\r\n\r\nSo why can't your comments box
    handle something simple like HTML?\r\n\r\nSeems rather silly to me that it can't.\r\n\r\nWayne\r\n\r\nmadhatter.ca\r\nweblit.ca\r\n\r\n"

  content: "I don't understand what it means. If Android platform is making use of
    Harmony, then it is their call to make sure all is right in distributing Harmony
    along with its platform. \r\n\r\nWell, Java is open source so is Apache software,
    what is the issue????"

  content: I, personally, wouldn't draw any conclusions from this. It may be that
    Oracle is substantiating that an organization like Apache understands the licensing
    requirements surrounding the Java platform, so why wouldn't Google? Only Oracle's
    lawyers know for sure. It doesn't sound to me that Apache is being attacked.

  content: "Are there any plans to take futher action on the TCK issue?\r\n\r\nI think
    Google would be in big disadvantage unless ASF take TCK issue to court."

  content: "I wonder if all legal letters from the Foundation shouldn't be under a
    Creative Commons Copyright License, preferably one which has 'copyleft' provisions,
    so that any opponent who quotes a significant amount of your letter thus places
    his letter under your license?\r\n\r\nAfter all, why not make copyright work for
    you?\r\n\r\nWayne\r\nmadhatter.ca\r\nweblit.ca\r\n\r\n "

  content: Is Oracle prentending Google discussed about alleged misuses of Oracle
    code with the Apache Foundation? That's crazy! I would use the occasion to sue
    them about licence abuse in the TCK conflict...
