Apache Cassandra powers massive data sets quickly and reliably without compromising performance, whether running in the Cloud or partially on-premise in a hybrid data store. Its fully distributed architecture provides unparalleled fault tolerance to ensure applications will not go offline, and its linear scalability allows them to reach massive sizes while successfully handling thousands of requests per second. &quot;In five years, Apache Cassandra has grown into one of the most widely used NoSQL databases in the world and serves as the backbone for some of today&rsquo;s most popular applications,&quot; said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra. Under the Hood New features in Apache Cassandra v2.0 include lightweight transactions, triggers, and CQL (Cassandra Query Language) enhancements that increase productivity in creating modern, data-driven applications. &quot;Cassandra 2.0 makes it easier than ever for developers to migrate from relational databases and become productive quickly,&quot; added Ellis. New features and improvements include: Lightweight transactions allow ensuring operation linearizability similar to the serializable isolation level offered by relational databases, which prevents conflicts during concurrent requests Triggers, which enable pushing performance-critical code close to the data it deals with, and simplify integration with event-driven frameworks like Storm CQL enhancements such as cursors and improved index support Improved compaction, keeping read performance from deteriorating under heavy write load Eager retries to avoid query timeouts by sending redundant requests to other replicas if too much time elapses on the original request Custom Thrift server implementation based on LMAX Disruptor that achieves lower message processing latencies and better throughput with flexible buffer allocation strategies&lt;/p&gt; Strong Community Engagement and Adoption &lt;/p&gt; The Apache Cassandra developer community includes some of the brightest minds in Big Data.
