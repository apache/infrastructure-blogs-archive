<p><strong>The CloudStack Booth</strong></p>
<p>Community members representing and sharing knowledge of Apache CloudStack with the broader cloud industry had a thoroughly enjoyable time at the conference. We manage to engage with global cloud providers, telecoms, consulting companies, gaming companies and service providers.</p>
<p>We discussed a lot with attendees on topics like building hybrid clouds, keeping infrastructure costs under control, decreasing cloud complexity, and ensuring the best infrastructure for running containers at scale while maintaining investments in infrastructure low.</p>

<p><strong>Explore the Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for Apache CloudStack</strong></p>
<p>The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The provider is available under the Apache 2 open-source license and is managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The Cluster API brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.</p>

<p><strong>Why Choose Apache CloudStack </strong></p>
<p>Apache CloudStack helps cloud builders solve their key challenges &ndash; costs, vendor lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical servers installed in geographically distributed data centers. The turnkey solution, made for cloud builders and managed service providers, is open-source and easy to implement, manage and scale - particularly when compared to alternative cloud orchestration platforms.</p>
