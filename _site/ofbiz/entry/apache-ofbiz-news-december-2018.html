<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News December 2018 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about our usual end of year tasks to create a new branch, a new&nbsp;Marketplace plugin, and also some news about various upgrades were are implementing. Gradle upgraded to version 5.0 OFBiz has been upgraded to Gradle 5.0&nbsp; which is much faster for loading, as it runs parallel processes for downloading dependencies, and it is also more compatible with newer versions of Java. This will speed up the OFBiz installation and general running. Please refer to Jira task OFBIZ-9972 for more information about what has been implemented. Thanks very much to&nbsp;Mathieu Lirzin,&nbsp;Taher Alkhateeb and also everyone who contributed to getting this upgrade implemented. New Framework and Plugin 18.12 Branches As part of our usual end of year tasks, the community has worked on creating a new branch&nbsp;Release 18.12&nbsp;for both the framework and the plugin. Please note that ofbiz-framework-18.12 branch and ofbiz-plugins-18.12 branch are not yet officially released and will be stabilized over the next few months until the community is satisfied that they are ready for release. A big thank you to Nicolas Malin and everyone who contributed to this effort. Note: The community is also working on the plan to release OFBiz 17.12 branch. In past one year, the community had worked on stabilizing the 17.12 branch. Upgrade to Java 11 Discussions have started on our development mailing list for upgrading OFBiz to Java 11. OFBiz currently runs using Java 8, we are making sure that we understand the changes and there should not be any potential issues if we go ahead with the upgrade. You can check the progress of the work being done in the Jira task OFBIZ-10757 Thanks very much to Taher Alkhateeb for starting the discussion about this upgrade and also everyone who participated by providing feedback or comments. OFBiz as Marketplace The main discussion topic this month has been around the creation of a new &#39;marketplace&#39; plugin for OFBiz. This potential new plugin will behave similar to ecommerce&nbsp;plugin but will also offer sellers the ability to sell their&nbsp;products on the marketplace We have begun collecting and documenting user stories about the functionality that we would like to implement. User stories will soon be available at: Home &gt; Documentation &gt; OFBiz Features &gt; Proposed Features &gt;&nbsp;Marketplace.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News December 2018</h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about our usual end of year tasks to create a new branch, a new&nbsp;Marketplace plugin, and also some news about various upgrades were are implementing.</p>
<h2>Gradle upgraded to version 5.0</h2>
<p>OFBiz has been upgraded to <a href="https://gradle.org/whats-new/gradle-5/">Gradle 5.0&nbsp;</a> which is much faster for loading, as it runs parallel processes for downloading dependencies, and it is also more compatible with newer versions of Java. This will speed up the OFBiz installation and general running. Please refer to Jira task <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-9972" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">OFBIZ-9972</a> for more information about what has been implemented.</p>
<p>Thanks very much to&nbsp;Mathieu Lirzin,&nbsp;Taher Alkhateeb and also everyone who contributed to getting this upgrade implemented.</p>
<h2>New Framework and Plugin 18.12 Branches</h2>
<p>As part of our usual end of year tasks, the community has worked on creating a new branch&nbsp;Release 18.12&nbsp;for both the framework and the plugin.</p>
<p>Please note that <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ofbiz/ofbiz-framework/branches/release18.12/">ofbiz-framework-18.12</a> branch and <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ofbiz/ofbiz-plugins/branches/release18.12/">ofbiz-plugins-18.12</a> branch are not yet officially released and will be stabilized over the next few months until the community is satisfied that they are ready for release.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Nicolas Malin and everyone who contributed to this effort.</p>
<p>Note: <strong>The community is also working on the plan to release OFBiz 17.12 branch. In past one year, the community had worked on stabilizing the 17.12 branch.</strong></p>

<h2>Upgrade to Java 11</h2>
<p>Discussions have started on our development mailing list for upgrading OFBiz to Java 11. OFBiz currently runs using Java 8, we are making sure that we understand the changes and there should not be any potential issues if we go ahead with the upgrade. You can check the progress of the work being done in the Jira task <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10757&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547183373522000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvXAk4gOGTUi8J32ymQulbZeq9KQ" style="color: #1155cc;">OFBIZ-10757<br /></a></p>
<p>Thanks very much to Taher Alkhateeb for starting the discussion about this upgrade and also everyone who participated by providing feedback or comments.</p>
<h2>OFBiz as Marketplace</h2>
<p>The main discussion topic this month has been around the creation of a new 'marketplace' plugin for OFBiz. This potential new plugin will behave similar to ecommerce&nbsp;plugin but will also offer sellers the ability to sell their&nbsp;products on the marketplace</p>
<p>We have begun collecting and documenting user stories about the functionality that we would like to implement. User stories will soon be available at:</p>
<p>Home > Documentation > OFBiz Features > Proposed Features >&nbsp;Marketplace.</p>
<p>A big thanks goes to Rishi Solanki for starting the discussion and everyone who participated.</p>
