Tez leverages Hadoop&rsquo;s unparalleled ability to process petabyte-scale datasets, allowing projects in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem (such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig) and third-party software vendors to express fit-to-purpose data processing logic in a way that meets their unique demands for fast response times and extreme throughput.&nbsp; Tez&#39;s customizable execution architecture enables scalable, purpose-built data-processing computations, and also allows for dynamic performance optimizations based on real information about the data and the resources required to process it.&nbsp; Tez was originally developed by Hortonworks, and entered the Apache Incubator in February 2013. The project currently has code contributions from individuals representing Cloudera, Facebook, Hortonworks, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo.&nbsp; &quot;I&#39;m really happy to see the graduation of Apache Tez from the Incubator. The community has worked diligently to get to this point,&quot; said Chris Mattmann, Apache Tez Incubator Mentor, and Chief Architect, Instrument and Science Data Systems Section at NASA JPL. &quot;Tez makes queries on Hadoop databases like Hive interactive, instead of batch oriented. Tez is similar to recently graduated projects in the Apache Big Data ecosystem including Apache Spark and also Apache Tajo, projects with similar goals of speeding up queries in Hadoop. My data science team at NASA is looking at Tez, Spark, and Tajo and evaluating them on projects in climate science and in radio astronomy.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Netflix builds its big data analytics platform in the cloud by leveraging open source technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Hive, Pig and more,&quot; said Cheolsoo Park, Senior Software Engineer at Netflix and Vice President of Apache Pig. &quot;While MapReduce has served us well for years, Tez is a welcome improvement. Netflix has made significant contributions to the development of Pig-on-Tez alongside with Hortonworks, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. Based on our initial benchmark of Pig-on-Tez, it is nearly twice as fast as MapReduce for some of our heavy production jobs. This is a huge improvement in efficiency. We look forward to deploying Pig-on-Tez in production this year. We thank the Tez community for all your help and are excited that Tez has become an Apache top-level project.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yahoo&#39;s business is built on Hadoop; it&#39;s essential to our ability to deliver personalized, delightful experiences for our users and create value for our advertisers,&quot; said Peter Cnudde, Vice President of Engineering, Yahoo. &quot;We&#39;re committed to working closely with the Apache community to evolve the processing of Big Data at scale with technologies such as Apache Hive, Tez, and YARN.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;It&#39;s fantastic to see Tez promoted to a top-level Apache project. Microsoft has invested in improving Hive performance by bringing innovation used in SQL Server to Hadoop, through contributions to Tez,&quot; said Eric Hanson, Principal Engineer in the HDInsight team at Microsoft and an Apache Hive Committer. &quot;Hive on Tez enables major performance improvements of up to 100x, and we&#39;re happy it&#39;s available now on Microsoft Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based solution for the cloud.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Tez is on its way to becoming a cornerstone of core Apache projects like Apache Hive and Apache Pig and has been embraced by other important Open Source projects like Cascading.
