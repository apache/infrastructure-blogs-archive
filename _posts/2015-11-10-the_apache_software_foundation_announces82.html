<div><b><i>Open Source distributed database management system simplifies Big Data application development with new features, performance optimizations, and significant storage savings</i></b></div>
<div><b><br /></b></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;10 November 2015&mdash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache&trade; Cassandra&trade; v3.0, the Open Source distributed database management system.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, Apache Cassandra provides high availability with no single point of failure. v3.0 is a new milestone in the database's evolution with performance optimizations, improved data consistency operations, an average of 50% data storage savings, and numerous important developer enhancements, such as new materialized views, that greatly simplify application development.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"It's exciting to break new ground with the materialized views in Cassandra 3.0," said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra. "Open source at Apache is clearly the leading source of innovation in the Big Data space today."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Cassandra 3.0 represents a significant shift in both plumbing and usability," said Robbie Strickland, Director of Software Engineering at The Weather Channel. "A CQL-centric storage model and the advent of materialized views should dramatically reduce the learning curve and help increase its utility for a wider range of use cases."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Materialized Views in Cassandra 3.0 continues the CQL tradition of adding new features that improve usability," said Aaron Morton, founder at Big Data consultancy The Last Pickle. "By supporting a common use pattern as a first class entity in the database, developers of all levels will find it easier to deliver great products."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"With each version Cassandra has consistently raised the bar on distributed database scalability and performance," said Russell Bradberry, founder at content analytics company SimpleReach. "Version 3.0 does all this and adds an amazing feature set. &nbsp;Materialized views and User Defined Aggregates will allow SimpleReach to move a large portion of data manipulation logic to where the data lives. We anticipate a dramatic increase in performance and reliability across the board."</div>
