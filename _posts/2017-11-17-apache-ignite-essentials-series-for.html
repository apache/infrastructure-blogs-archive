<p>We finally made this happen! I&rsquo;m happy to invite all of the software architects and engineers out there to a series of webinars that will introduce you to the fundamental capabilities of in-memory computing platforms such as Apache Ignite.</p>
<p>
There will also be a mix of theory and practice. A lot of code examples are waiting to be shown so that you can apply the theory in practice right away.</p>
<p>
The series consists of two parts.</p>
