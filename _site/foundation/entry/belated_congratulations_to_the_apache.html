<meta name="description" content="The Apache Software Foundation raises a glass to Apache Turbine, the rapid-development Web application framework that&#39;s been a part of the Foundation over the past decade. Originally a sub-project of the Apache Jakarta Open Source Java solutions, Apache Turbine became a Top-level Project (TLP) in 2007. Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers to quickly build secure Web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used independently from its Web portion to be easily used in other applications. Websites that use Apache Turbine include JRank, FlashCan, JXTA.org, OpenOffice.org, and Tigris.org. The project has also influenced numerous projects such as Apache DB Torque, Apache Maven&nbsp;and several Apache Commons components. In addition, the project announced the release of Turbine-4.0-M1.&nbsp;This milestone release is not intended for production, but rather for verification of newly-integrated Fulcrum services and to gain experience migrating a 2.3.3 installation to the new architecture. The project is seeking feedback from the community to release a stable version of Turbine later this year. For more information, please see http://s.apache.org/bXV # # # &lt;/p&gt;" />
