<meta name="description" content="Open Source Big Data middleware metadata framework in use at Children&#39;s Hospital Los Angeles Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, DARPA MEMEX and XDATA, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the National Cancer Institute, among others. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;29 June 2016&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache&reg; OODT&trade; v1.0, the Big Data middleware metadata framework. OODT is a grid middleware framework for science data processing, information integration, and retrieval. As &quot;middleware for metadata&quot; (and vice versa), OODT is used for computer processing workflow, hardware and file management, information integration, and linking databases. The OODT architecture allows distributed computing and data resources to be searchable and utilized by any end user. &quot;Apache OODT 1.0 is a great milestone in this project,&quot; said Tom Barber, Vice President of Apache OODT. &quot;Effectively managing data pools has historically been problematic for some users, and OODT addresses a number of the issues faced. v1.0 allows us to prepare for some big changes within the platform with new UI designs for user-facing apps and data flow processing under the hood. It&#39;s an exciting time in the data management sector and we believe Apache OODT can be at the forefront of it.&quot; OODT 1.0 signals a stage in the project where the initial scope of the platform is feature- complete and ready for general consumption. v1.0 features include: Data ingestion and processing; Automatic data discovery and metadata extraction; Metadata management; Workflow processing and support; and Resource management Originally created at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1998 as a way to build a national framework for data sharing, OODT has been instrumental to the National Cancer Institute&#39;s Early Detection Research Network for managing distributed scientific data sets across 20+ institutions nationwide for more than a decade. Apache OODT is in use in many scientific data system projects in Earth science, planetary science, and astronomy at NASA, such as the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project (LMMP), NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) Sounder PEATE Testbed, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) project, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission testbed. In addition, OODT is used for large-scale data management and data preparation tasks in the DARPA MEMEX and XDATA efforts, and for supporting research and data analysis within the pediatric intensive care domain in collaboration with Children&#39;s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and its Laura P. and Leland K. Whittier Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (VPICU), among many other applications. &quot;To watch Apache OODT grow from an internal NASA project to 1.0 where it is today and dozens of releases is an amazing feat. I truly believe having it at the ASF has allowed it to grow and prosper. We are doubling down on our commitment to Apache OODT, investing in its enhancement and use in several national-scale projects,&quot; said Chris Mattmann, member of the Apache OODT Project Management Committee, and Chief Architect, Instrument and Science Data Systems Section at NASA JPL. &quot;Apache OODT processes some of the world&#39;s biggest data sets, distributes and manages them, and makes sure science happens in a timely and accurate fashion.&quot; OODT entered the Apache Incubator in January 2010, and graduated as a Top-level Project in November 2010.&nbsp; Catch Apache OODT in action at ApacheCon Europe, 14-18 November 2016 in Seville, Spain http://apachecon.com/ .
