<p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;">We finally got it out the door, it took a lot longer than we expected. However, we have a ton of bug fixes rolled into this relase as well as a number of new features.</p>
<ul style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;">
<li>Some of the bug fixes include: concurrency issues, mono compilation issues, and memory leaks.</li>
<li>A lot of work has been done to clean up the code base, refactoring the code and project files, and providing build scripts</li>
<li>A couple of new features: Search.Regex, Simple Faceted Search, and simple phrase analysis in the Fast Vector Highlighter</li>
<li>Download it now on our <a href="http://lucenenet.apache.org/download.cgi">downloads page</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;">Just around the corner is a 2.9.4g release (early January), that has been substantially refactored and uses generics across the board.</p>
