<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our service offerings, and to make it easier to interact with the Infrastructure team we are launching an instance of JIRA Service Desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should make it much simpler to submit common JIRA issues, such as SVN->GIT migration, New wiki, New JIRA project, etc. The forms ask for the minimum amount of data we would need to complete the request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One common theme we found that delayed resolution was needing additional information to action tickets. Service Desk allows us to request the exact information needed for a specific task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to ask everyone to start using this to submit new issues. You can access this new service here: &nbsp;<a href="https://helpinfrahelpyou.apache.org">https://helpinfrahelpyou.apache.org</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;or &nbsp;<a href="https://infrahelp.apache.org">https://infrahelp.apache.org</a></p></p>
