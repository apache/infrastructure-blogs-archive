<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News March 2019 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have more news about a new Youtube playlist, some improvements in order and return flow along with our usual list of features and improvements. Applied OWASP Dependency Check as per Gradle recommendation OWASP Dependency Check is a tool for checking the Java libraries you use have no security issues. The feature was used when OFBiz worked with Ant build tool. Since OFBiz now uses Gradle, all dependent libraries (i.e. also dependencies from the libraries OFBiz uses and recursively) are loaded by Gradle and analyzed by the OWASP Dependency Check plugin. So it&#39;s materially impossible to check all the possible vulnerabilities.&nbsp;Further explorations concluded that with&nbsp;Gradle 2.1 it is recommended to use the plugins {} block for binary plugins instead of the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; apply() method. Hence, it will be applied as per the Gradle recommendation in plugins block.&nbsp; Please refer to OFBIZ-10700 and Mail thread. Thanks, Jacques Le Roux, Mathieu Lirzin, Shi Jinghai, Michael Brohl, and to everyone who contributed towards this effort. Improvements in storeOrder Service The current implementation of storeOrder service doesn&#39;t support some of the OrderHeader fields namely priority and isRushOrder. The community decided to add conditional support for these fields, that means if the value comes in the parameter then it will be stored otherwise not. Please refer to OFBIZ-10855 and Mail thread. Thanks, Rishi Solanki for initiating and putting efforts in this direction, Ankush Upadhyay, Suraj Khurana, and Swapnil M Mane for their valuable inputs. Improvement in return order to put a constraint on after no of days return is allowed In the current implementation, we can create a return for order without checking when that order is placed, it might be years long. The proposal is to allow creating return till after that specific day of order completion. The proposal is still under discussion. Please refer to Mail thread. Thanks, Suraj Khurana for initiating the discussion and everyone who participated by providing their valuable inputs. Updates on OFBiz Video Tutorial Series In order to improve the OFBiz learning curve, a new playlist is created. Main highlights of this playlist are: It contains the videos in a sequential manner from beginner to expert. This playlist will always be in sync with the trunk branch. The main idea is to always have videos which work with OFBiz trunk branch. Please refer to Youtube Playlist and Mail thread. Thanks very much, Pranay and Swapnil M Mane for their continuous efforts New features and improvements Functional enhancements and improvements as well as updates of third party libraries and source code refactoring: Framework Improves readabillity of Gralde build script.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News March 2019</h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have more news about a new Youtube playlist, some improvements in order and return flow along with our usual list of features and improvements.</p>
<h2>Applied OWASP <g class="gr_ gr_78 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="78" data-gr-id="78">Dependency Check</g> as per Gradle recommendation</h2>
<p><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/About+OWASP+Dependency+Check">OWASP <g class="gr_ gr_79 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="79" data-gr-id="79">Dependency Check</g></a> is a tool for checking the Java libraries you use have no security issues. The feature was used when OFBiz worked with <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build tool. Since OFBiz now uses <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, all dependent libraries (i.e. also dependencies from the libraries OFBiz uses and recursively) are loaded by Gradle and analyzed by the OWASP <g class="gr_ gr_80 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="80" data-gr-id="80">Dependency Check</g> plugin. So it's materially impossible to check all the possible vulnerabilities.&nbsp;Further explorations concluded that with&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/2.1/userguide/plugins.html">Gradle 2.1</a> it is recommended to use the plugins {} block for binary plugins instead of the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; apply() method. Hence, it will be applied as per the Gradle recommendation in plugins block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10700">OFBIZ-10700</a> and <a href="https://markmail.org/message/7utt6ylkntjzix27">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jacques Le Roux, Mathieu Lirzin, Shi Jinghai, Michael Brohl, and to everyone who contributed towards this effort.</p>
<h2>Improvements in <g class="gr_ gr_81 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="81" data-gr-id="81">storeOrder</g> Service</h2>
<p>The current implementation of storeOrder service doesn't support some of the OrderHeader fields namely priority and isRushOrder. The community decided to add conditional support for these fields, that means if the value comes in the parameter then it will be stored otherwise not.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-10855">OFBIZ-10855</a> and <a href="https://markmail.org/message/wofzndanmgogfrfs">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Rishi Solanki for initiating and putting efforts in this direction, Ankush Upadhyay, Suraj Khurana, and Swapnil M Mane for their valuable inputs.</p>
<h2>Improvement in return order to put a constraint on after no of days return is allowed</h2>
<p>In the current implementation, we can create a return for order without checking when that order is placed, it might be years long. The proposal is to allow creating return till after that specific day of order completion.</p>
<p>The proposal is still under discussion. Please refer to <a href="https://markmail.org/message/fveuticnzafva4wy">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks, Suraj Khurana for initiating the discussion and everyone who participated by providing their valuable inputs.</p>
<h2>Updates on OFBiz Video Tutorial Series</h2>
<p>In order to improve the OFBiz learning curve, a new playlist is created. Main highlights of this playlist are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It contains the videos in a sequential manner from beginner to expert.</li>
<li>This playlist will always be in sync with the trunk branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main idea is to always have videos which work with OFBiz trunk branch.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIS2kftvsq4&amp;list=PLobIkeUbRXqc-lwvbdbajPJdbWjFm82Dj">Youtube Playlist</a> and <a href="https://markmail.org/message/yfmpadhfibiyarpn">Mail thread</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks very much, Pranay and Swapnil M Mane for their continuous efforts</p>
