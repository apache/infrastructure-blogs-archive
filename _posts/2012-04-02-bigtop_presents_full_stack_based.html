Just a couple months ago Apache Hadoop fans, committers and alike were cheered up by the news that Hadoop community has released a long awaited <a title="Hadoop 1.0 release notes" href="http://is.gd/COgriE">version 1.0 of the famous Hadoop</a> data crunching platform.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be writing this blog because while I am doing it, Apache mirrors are synchronizing the first ever release of Haodop 1.0 based data analytic stack that has been fully built, validated, and packaged by the Apache Bigtop project (incubating).</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman: we are proud to present a collaborative effort of many teams and individuals, that allows Bigtop to put together a first ever 100% open-source Apache Hadoop big data stack.</p>
<p>Just a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
