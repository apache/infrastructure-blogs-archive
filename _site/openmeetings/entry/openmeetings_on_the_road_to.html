The next Board meeting will be at the 19th December of 2012, we will submit our resolution and hopefully the Board will follow the recommendation from the Incubator to establish Apache OpenMeetings as top level project! However, as we are still an Incubator project we did submit also a quarterly update of our project. Project and community status: Roadmap for OpenMeetings 2.1 and 3.0 has been discussed http://markmail.org/message/ugazdo4xgclakrib Version 3.0 is mainly about a HTML5 version of OpenMeetings. Discussion resolution was to choose Wicket as basic JavaScript framework and jQuery for pure client side tasks. By now we did already implement an HTML5 interface for the administration section. Discussion which approaches to use for the actual conferencing part is still ongoing A testing application for AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation, build into Flash Player 11.2) was implemented and is in review http://markmail.org/message/g2zdwuruu7vuizvg A new clustering of OpenMeetings will be available with the next release of the 2.x tree, we have been discussing some approaches, see http://markmail.org/message/jvkawqwqrpajk2qo and working on the implementation Plugins are now hosted at apche-extras.org, index of plugins: http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/hosting/search?q=openmeetings A fast feather track was presented at the ApacheCon EU: https://blogs.apache.org/openmeetings/entry/openmeetings_apachecon_presentation_slide See also: http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/December2012" />
