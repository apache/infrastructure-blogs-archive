Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones, tablets and tv). Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively in browsers. The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications. Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript cross-compiler. It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as Falcon. Both are contained in the release package and are used by the FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS." />

    <p>The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache<br />
FlexJS SDK 0.6.0 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.6.0.</p>
<p>Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for<br />
building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently<br />
on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones,<br />
tablets and tv).</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use<br />
MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the<br />
same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively<br />
in browsers.  The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova<br />
(Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.</p>
<p>Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript<br />
cross-compiler.  It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as<br />
Falcon.  Both are contained in the release package and are used by the<br />
FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS.</p>
<p>This is the fourth release of FlexJS and FalconJX.  It is &lsquo;beta'<br />
quality.  In this release, all JS used to implement framework<br />
functionality is actually written in AS and cross-compiled, which helps<br />
show that there is developer productivity improvements using higher-level<br />
languages.  In addition, the there is a new Storage.swc for working with<br />
the persistent storage and a Reflection.swc for basic reflection<br />
functionality.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a new tool called asnodec (in js/bin).  It causes<br />
the compiler to output an index.js that can be run with Node.js.</p>
<p>Also, Apache FlexJS 0.6.0 is now available as a npm package. On a system<br />
With npm installed, users can easily install FlexJS with the command:</p>
<pre>  npm install flexjs -g </pre>
<p>Or you can use the Installer as described below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the<br />
features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we<br />
grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest<br />
productivity developing applications that can run in the most places.<br />
These releases may not handle production needs.  Expect lots of bugs and<br />
missing features.  Please file bugs at:</p>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/</a></p>
<p>For questions about how to use FlexJS and FalconJX, send email to<br />
users@flex.apache.org.  Please try to prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or<br />
[FalconJX] so it is clear the questions refer to this release and not the<br />
Flex SDK and MXMLC compiler.</p>
<p>For questions and feedback on the development of the source code in these<br />
release, send email to dev@flex.apache.org.  Again, please prefix the<br />
subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX].</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX are available in source and binary<br />
form from the following download page:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html">http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html</a></p>
<p>When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the<br />
downloads using signatures or MD5 hashes.</p>
<p>A simple way to try these releases is to use the<br />
InstallApacheFlex 3.1 or 3.2 application which is available at the<br />
following url:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/installer.html">http://flex.apache.org/installer.html</a></p>
<p>Choose Apache FlexJS 0.6.0 and it will create an Adobe Flash<br />
Builder-compatible SDK that uses the Falcon and FalconJX compilers to<br />
generate SWFs and HTML/JS/CSS output.  You can also use FDT as your IDE<br />
for developing FlexJS applications.  Some folks have been successful<br />
using IntelliJ, FlashDevelop as well.  Moonshine is also working on<br />
FlexJS support.</p>
