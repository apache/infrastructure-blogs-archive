<p>The Apache OpenWebBeans team started working towards implementing the CDI-1.1 specification in our trunk. </p>
<p>Further bugfixing of the CDI-1.0 version of OWB will be done in the owb_1.1.x branch.</p>
<p>We have not yet set a timeline for trunk, but we will take the chance and rework our SPI and cleanup some sub-optimal parts in our internas while approaching CDI-1.1</p>
