  <br />ApacheCon, the official conference, trainings, and expo of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), heads to Vancouver, Canada, this November, with dozens of technical, business, and community-focused sessions for beginner, intermediate, and expert audiences.</p>
<p>Now in its 11th year, the ASF develops and shepherds nearly 150 Top-Level Projects and new initiatives in the Apache Incubator and Labs. With hundreds of thousands of applications deploying ASF products and code contributions by more than 2,500 Committers from around the world, the Apache community is recognized as among the most robust, successful, and respected in Open Source.</p>
<p>This year's ApacheCon focuses on highly-relevant, professionally-directed presentations that demonstrate specific problems and real-world solutions. We welcome proposals --from developers and users alike-- in the areas of "Apache and ...":</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">... Enterprise Solutions (from ActiveMQ to Axis2 to ServiceMix, OFBiz to Chemistry, the gang's all here!)<br />
  <br />... Cloud Computing (Hadoop, Cassandra, HBase,&nbsp;CouchDB, and friends)<br />
  <br />... Emerging Technologies + Innovation (Incubating projects such as&nbsp;Libcloud, Stonehenge, and Wookie)<br />
  <br />... Community Leadership (mentoring and meritocracy, GSoC and related initiatives)<br />
  <br />... Data Handling, Search&nbsp;+ Analytics (Lucene, Solr, Mahout, OODT, Hive and friends)<br />
  <br />... Pervasive Computing (Felix/OSGi, Tomcat, MyFaces Trinidad, and friends)<br />

<p>
