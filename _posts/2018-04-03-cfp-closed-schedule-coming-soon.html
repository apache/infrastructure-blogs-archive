<p>The Call for Papers has now closed for <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/">ApacheCon North America 2018</a>, and the schedule will be coming soon. We will also have another keynote announcement in the coming days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you all for your session submissions. We have about 3.75 sessions per available slot, so it's going to be challenging to select the schedule. Stay tunes - check back here, on the <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/">ApacheCon website</a>, and follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/apachecon">Twitter</a>, for the lasted news.</p></p>
