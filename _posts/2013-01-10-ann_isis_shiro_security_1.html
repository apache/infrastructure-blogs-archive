<p>
The Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis Shiro Security 1.0.0, along with an update to the Quickstart (Wicket/Restful/JDO) archetype, v1.0.1. </p>
<p>The main new feature is the integration of Apache Shiro [1], to be used for authentication and authorization.   The quickstart archetype has been updated to integrate this new component [2].  Full release notes are available at [3] on the Isis website. </p>
<p>In addition, the quickstart archetype has been simplified so that both the Wicket viewer [4] and the Restful Objects viewer [5] are run within the same webapp.  There is also a new welcome page to help new users get started. </p>
<p>There is one known minor issue: the links on the welcome page to the wicket viewer and restful objects viewer are incorrect if run outside of the root context.</p>
<p>You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [6], or download the release and build it from source [7].</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>-The Isis team</p>
