  <p><strong>Attendees to Experience &quot;Tomorrow's Technology Today&quot; and Celebrate Two Decades of Open Source Innovation &quot;The Apache Way&quot; in Chicago, Las Vegas, and Berlin</strong></p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p><strong>Wakefield, MA —3 April 2019—</strong> The Apache<sup>®</sup> Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that its call for presentations (CFPs) and registration are open for ApacheCon™, the ASF's official global conference series.</p> 
  <p>ApacheCon draws attendees from more than 60 countries to experience &quot;Tomorrow's Technology Today&quot; by showcasing key Open Source technologies independent of business interests, corporate biases, or sales pitches. ApacheCon content is selected entirely by Apache projects and their communities, enabling participants at all levels to learn about the latest innovations in dozens of categories that include Big Data, containers, Cloud, DevOps, IoT, servers, and Web frameworks, among others. Participants learn about Open Source development &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, BarCamps, and more in a deliberately intimate, collaborative, vendor-neutral environment.</p> 
  <p>&quot;The first ApacheCon started 21 years ago and quickly rose to prominence for its strong community presence, both in content and spirit,&quot; said Rich Bowen, ASF Vice President of Conferences. &quot;Through the years, ApacheCon has featured Apache projects from virtually every technology area in Open Source, presented by hundreds of individuals from the greater Apache community. We are proud to continue to be the primary gathering of the collective Apache community worldwide, and look forward to celebrating the ASF's 20th Anniversary together at ApacheCon.&quot;</p> 
  <p>Attendees will join The Apache Software Foundation to celebrate its 20th Anniversary at the following events:</p>

  <p><strong>Registration<br /></strong>Registration is open for all three events, with time-limited, early registration incentives and additional discounted rates available for individual participants as well as groups.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sponsors<br /></strong>ApacheCon sponsors gain visibility and competitive advantage by engaging with the greater Apache community, industry influencers, and potential future collaborators.
