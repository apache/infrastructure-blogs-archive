<p>The Apache Software Foundation will be participating in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">Google Summer of Code</a>&nbsp;again this year as a mentoring organization.</p> 
  <p><a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs#whatis">Google Summer of Code</a> is a program where students work on open source projects backed by a stipend granted by Google. The Apache Software Foundation has been participating in the program since its inception in 2005.</p> 
  <p>Each year, 30-40 students are guided by volunteer mentors from various Apache communities. During the summer they learn what it means to participate in a diverse open source community and develop open source software &quot;The Apache Way&quot;. Many of past students are now active contributors to our projects.</p> 
  <p>This year we hope to build on our previous successes and again build student interest and enthusiasm in The Apache Software Foundation. Our list of project ideas (at <a href="http://s.apache.org/gsoc2012tasks">http://s.apache.org/gsoc2012tasks</a>) already contains over 100 ideas spanning more than 25 Apache projects. But that's only what <i>we</i> have come up with. A lot of students have their very own itch to scratch and approach our projects with their own ideas.</p> 
  <p>If you are enrolled as a university student and always wanted to get involved with Apache, here's is your chance. Browse our <a href="http://s.apache.org/gsoc2012tasks">ideas list</a>, approach the projects you are most interested in, discuss your ideas, get involved, code the summer away, and at the end, get a nice paycheck from Google!</p>
