  <div>This is primarily a bug fix release, with several new features/improvements, including:</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>* ISIS-1510 - Improve support for docker containers by allowing isis configuration properties to be overridden using either system properties or an ISIS_OPT environment variable</div>
  <div>* ISIS-1499 - Improve BookmarkService to be able to &quot;lookup&quot; domain services, so that can schedule background commands against a service.</div>
  <div>* ISIS-1508 - The integration test framework should be more resilient to badly behaved tests that leave the transaction incomplete</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].</div>
