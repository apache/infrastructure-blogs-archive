<p><b><i>World's largest Open Source foundation provides $22B+ in community-led software 100% free of charge for the common good</i></b><br></p><p><b>Wilmington, DE —24 March 2021—</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today its 22nd Anniversary.</p><p>Originally established by the 21-member Apache Group, who oversaw the then-3-year-old Apache HTTP Server, the ASF today is the world's largest, vendor-neutral, Open Source foundation, comprising 800+ individual Members, 8,100+ Committers, and 40,000+ code contributors located on every continent. Conservatively valued at more than $22B, Apache’s 350+ projects and 37 incubating podlings are all freely-available to the public-at-large, at 100% no cost, and with no licensing fees.</p><p>"Over the past 22 years the ASF has evolved to meet the growing needs of the greater community," said Sander Striker, Board Chair of The Apache Software Foundation. "The ASF enables people from all over the world to collaborate, develop, and shepherd the projects and communities that are helping individuals, sustaining businesses, and transforming industries."</p><p>Advancing its mission of providing software for the public good, the ASF's projects are integral to nearly every aspect of modern computing, benefitting billions worldwide. The "Apache Way" process of community-led, collaborative development has led to breakthrough innovations in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, Big Data, Build Management, Cloud Computing, Content Delivery and Management, Edge Computing and IoT, Fintech, Identity Management, Integration, Libraries, Messaging, Mobile, Search, Security, Servers, and Web Frameworks, among other categories. Projects undergoing development in the Apache Incubator span AI, Big Data, blockchain, Cloud computing, cryptography, deep learning, email, IoT, machine learning, microservices, mobile, operating systems, testing, visualization, and more.</p><p>Nearly half a million people participate in ASF projects and initiatives, including ApacheCon, the ASF's official global conference series; Community Development, which oversees contributor onboarding and mentoring and programs such as Google Summer of Code; and Diversity &amp; Inclusion, whose programs promote diversity, equity, and inclusion across the greater Apache community.</p><p>The ASF's influence is everywhere —countless ubiquitous and mission-critical applications across dozens of industries are powered by Apache projects; the Apache License 2.0 was the top-ranked Open Source license in 2020 (source: WhiteSource); the Apache Way is the backbone for open development and inner source environments; and new users, developers, and enthusiasts are onboarding to the greater Apache community every day (the ASF has been a Google Summer of Code mentoring organization for the past 16 years, since the program's inception). The ASF is the top-ranked Open Source not-for-profit organization with the most stars on GitHub (source: GitHub).</p><p>A just-released feature on the ASF in FOSSlife [1] states, "The Apache project has undeniably changed the world … Apache remains a crucial Web server, the most popular in the field. For building Open Source communities, the lessons learned by creating the project still resonate throughout the open source world. Every project is advised to respect the Apache value of 'community over code'."</p><p>ASF operations bolster Apache projects and their communities with infrastructure support, bandwidth, connectivity, servers, hardware, development environments, legal counsel, accounting services, trademark protection, marketing and publicity, educational events, and related administrative assistance. As a United States private 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF's day-to-day operating expenses are offset through tax-deductible sponsorships, corporate contributions, and individual donations.

The ASF's all-volunteer community grew from 21 original founders overseeing the Apache HTTP Server to 813 individual Members and 206 Project Management Committees who successfully lead 350+ Apache projects and initiatives in collaboration with nearly 8,100 Committers through the ASF’s meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way". Apache software is integral to nearly every end user computing device, from laptops to tablets to mobile devices across enterprises and mission-critical applications. Apache projects power most of the Internet, manage exabytes of data, execute teraflops of operations, and store billions of objects in virtually every industry. The commercially-friendly and permissive Apache License v2 is an Open Source industry standard, helping launch billion dollar corporations and benefiting countless users worldwide.
