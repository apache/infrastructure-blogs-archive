<p>After a *lot* of development effort, the Apache Isis committers are delighted to announce the release of v2.0.0-M3 of the framework.<br><br>This is a major milestone release that "re-platforms" Apache Isis so that it now runs on top of Spring Boot 2.x. &nbsp;JDK8 is the minimum.&nbsp; Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new convenience parent pom builds on top of Spring Boot&rsquo;s similar parent pom, to make it easy to develop new apps, along with simplified "mavendeps" pom&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>The Maven archetypes have been replaced with Starter Apps in github repos.</li>
<li>Configuration properties have been refactored, and can now be specified (with intellisense hints) using Spring&rsquo;s application.properties or application.yml</li>
</ul>
<p>New features:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>a new @Property#projecting allows view model summaries to be returned as "projections" of underlying entities.</li>
<li>new layout() method (or UI event) allows a domain object to specify which layout file should be used to render it.</li>
<li>there is no longer any need to specify @ParameterLayout#named()</li>
<li>there is now a security integration with Keycloak</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of new extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flyway (integrating with Spring Boot&rsquo;s support)</li>
<li>pdf.js (for Wicket viewer)</li>
<li>fullcalendar (for Wicket viewer)</li>
<li>excel download (for Wicket viewer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration test support, and BDD (Cucumber) "spec" support have been refactored to run on Spring Boot with Junit 5.</li>
<li>New demo app to demonstrate new features.</li>
<li>New smoketest app to catch regressions</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the website has been updated to use Antora.</p>
<p>Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].<br>You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2].<br>Alternatively, download the release and build it from source [3].<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br></p>
<p>--The Apache Isis team<br></p>
