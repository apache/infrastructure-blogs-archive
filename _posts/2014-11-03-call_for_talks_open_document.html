<p>FOSDEM 15 will be held at the ULB Campus Solbosch on Saturday, January<br />
31, and Sunday, February 1st, 2015.</p>
<p>Open document editors are coming again to FOSDEM with a shared devroom which gives every project in this area a chance to present ODF related<br />
developments and innovations. The devroom is jointly organized by Apache<br />
OpenOffice and LibreOffice.</p>
<p>We invite submission of talks for the Open Document Editors devroom, to<br />
be held on Saturday, January 31, from 10AM to 6PM.</p>
<p>Length of talks should be limited to 20 minutes, as we would like to<br />
have questions after each presentation, and to fit as many presenters as<br />
possible in the schedule. Exceptions must be explicitly requested and<br />
justified.</p>
<p>Technical talks (code, extensions, localization, QA, tools and adoption<br />
related cases) about open document editors or the ODF document format<br />
are welcome.</p>
<p>Submissions must be done by the speakers using the Pentabarf system:<br />
<br /><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15">https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15</a> </p>
<p>While filing your proposal, please provide the title of your talk, a<br />
short abstract (one or two paragraphs), some information about yourself<br />
(name, bio and photo, but please do remember that your profile might be<br />
already stored at Pentabarf) and specify what topic (Apache OpenOffice,<br />
LibreOffice, other ODF editors, ODF in general...) your talk is about.</p>
<p>You do not need to create a new account if you already have one. If the<br />
password has been lost, you can easily recover it.</p>
<p>The deadline is <b>Sunday, December 14, 2014</b>. Accepted speakers will be<br />
notified by December 28, 2014.</p>
<p>You can send any questions to the devroom mailing list:<br />
