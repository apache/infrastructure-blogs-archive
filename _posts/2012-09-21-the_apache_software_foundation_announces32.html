<p>The ApacheCon Europe Planning team today announced the program, speaker lineup, and sponsors for<br />
ApacheCon, the official conference of The Apache Software Foundation.</p>
<p>ApacheCon<br />
returns to Europe 5-8 November 2012 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in<br />
Sinsheim, Germany, attracting Open Source users, developers,<br />
gurus, students, novices, and enthusiasts to the newly-introduced<br />
"Community Edition" of ApacheCon --a smaller, less formal event aimed at<br />
 a more technically-oriented audience, and featuring an array of<br />
sessions focused on Apache projects and initiatives, plus MeetUps,<br />
FastFeather and Community Tracks, Hackathon, and BarCamp. This is an<br />
ideal opportunity for technologists currently developing Apache-based<br />
solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache<br />
project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open<br />
Source products and community practices.</p>
<p>ApacheCon Europe<br />
Community Edition is organized and run by the Apache community; all<br />
content for ApacheCon has been selected by Apache Project Management<br />
Committees. 13 tracks explore key Open Source applications and issues, from Big Data and Smart Search to Cloud and Infrastructure, and include:</p>
