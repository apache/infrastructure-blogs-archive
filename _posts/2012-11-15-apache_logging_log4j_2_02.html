<h2>The Apache Logging team is pleased to announce the Apache log4j 2.0-beta3 release!</h2>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the fifth release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community.</p>
<p>Changes in this version include:</p>
<h3>New features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-28:  Added PropertiesRewritePolicy and ability to define properties on a Logger.</li>
<li>LOG4J2-55:  Added ability to configure from an InputSource.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-108:  Fix NullPointerException in ClassLoaderContextSelector when no class is returned from<br />
        the SecurityManager. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-107:  PatternParser was not properly handling adjacent nested options </li>
<li>LOG4J2-95:  Add support for loading plugins inside the OSGi bundle. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-103:  The LogEvent was wrapping a ThrowableProxy with another ThrowableProxy when deserializing. Thanks to Das Archive. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-104:  Convert LogManager binding to use "regular" java properties instead of XML properties to workaround a<br />
        bug in Oracle's xmlparserv2 jar. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-102:  The Facility value was being improperly calculated. Thanks to Emanuele Colombo. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-101:  A NullPointerException would occur if no format value was passed to the SyslogAppender. Thanks to Emanuele Colombo. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-99:  MapRewritePolicy had an extra call to putAll that caused updates to behave like adds. Thanks to Das Archive. </li>
<li>Avoid NPE when duplicate LoggerContextFactorys are present. Allow factories to specify a weight to allow<br />
        real implementations to outrank test implementations. Provide a simple default LoggerContextFactory. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-97:  Added several missing classes and methods for Log4j 1.x compatibility. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-94:  Interpolator was not stripping Lookup key separator when trying to locate the default value for a variable. Thanks to Denis Treskunov. </li>
<li>Log4j 1.2 Category.forcedLog was wrapping the message with an ObjectMessage even if the parameter was an<br />
        ObjectMessage. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J2-105:  Add ability to customize the names of the Levels in the LevelPatternConverter. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-85:  Add ThreadContext.push(String format, Object... args) </li>
<li>Created combined jar to combine API and Core contents for users who only want the Log4j implementation. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-87:  Build pdf of user's guide. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-29:  Added font and fontSize parameters to HTMLLayout. Replace newlines in message with br tag. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Apache Log4j 2.0-beta2 requires a minimum of Java 5 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j12-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
