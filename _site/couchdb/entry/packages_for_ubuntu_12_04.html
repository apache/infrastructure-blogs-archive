<meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;m delighted to announce the availability of Apache CouchDB Ubuntu Precise (12.04) packages, with integrated upstart support. These have been contributed with support from Mobius Medical Systems, LP, who use Apache CouchDB in their product Mobius3D/FX for oncology and radiology, and funded the development of this work through the Couch Firm. This would not have been possible without the assistance of Jason DeRose (who has lead the 1.5.0 package going into the next Ubuntu Trusty release), and Noah Slater, who was surprised on reviewing the package to find so much of his original work there! Installation should be straightforward, usual caveats around making backup before upgrading precautions apply, noting that between 1.0.1 and 1.5.0 there are a number of key changes, including the on-disk data format used by the .couch files was upgraded. Although it should keep your dbs intact and do the right thing for your local.ini files, always have a backup - or two! sudo apt-get install python-software-properties -y sudo add-apt-repository ppa:couchdb/stable -y sudo apt-get update -y # remove any existing couchdb sudo apt-get remove couchdb couchdb-bin couchdb-common -yf # see my shiny 1.5.0 goodness sudo apt-get install -V couchdb Reading package lists...
