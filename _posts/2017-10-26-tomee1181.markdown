We're very pleased to announce that both Apache TomEE 7.0.4 and 1.7.5 are available to download on the TomEE website: <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/">http://tomee.apache.org/</a>

TomEE 7.x is the EE7 compatible version (A TomEE 8.x branch has also been created for EE8 compatibility work).

The 1.7.x version contains the EE6 certified version, from which all other versions are based.

You'll find the release notes for both of these new versions on the download page.

We'd also like to take this opportunity to welcome our latest committer, Svetlin Zarev. We're happy to have you aboard!

Have a great day everyone, and we hope you enjoy the latest versions.

The Apache TomEE PMC.
