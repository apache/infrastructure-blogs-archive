<p><i><b>First Apache Unconference in Australia to be held on 11th<br />
December 2010<br /></b></i><br />Forest Hill, MD - 6 December 2010 &ndash; The Apache Software<br />
Foundation (ASF) and the University of Sydney today announced BarCampApache<br />
Sydney, the ASF's first event in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Taking place at<br />
the University of Sydney's Darlington Centre on 11th December, BarCampApache is<br />
an attendee-driven event, focusing on "The Apache Way" of developing Open Source<br />
software. The event is open to the public free of charge.</p>
<p>"We are pleased<br />
to partner with the University of Sydney, whose commitment to sharing knowledge,<br />
high value collaboration, and next-generation innovation closely aligns with The<br />
Apache Software Foundation," said ASF President Jim Jagielski. "Events such as<br />
BarCampApache helps promote awareness of the tremendous impact of Open Source<br />
solutions, and an opportunity for members of the technology community to meet,<br />
network, and learn in an open environment."</p>
<p>The free to attend, one-day<br />
event will be facilitated by ASF Members Nick Burch, Aristedes Maniatis, Gavin<br />
McDonald, Noirin Plunkett, and Brett Porter. </p>
<p>The BarCampApache program<br />
will be proposed and decided by the participants themselves. Dozens of Open<br />
Source professionals, academics, and enthusiasts will address an array of topics<br />
focusing on Apache products, including open development techniques and best<br />
practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, as well as engaging with and incubating<br />
new initiatives within the ASF. The ad-hoc nature of BarCamp sessions allows<br />
discussions to flow freely and deepen with smaller groups throughout the<br />
day.</p>
<p>BarCampApache Sydney is hosted by the Information and Communications<br />
Technology centre at the University of Sydney, with additional support provided<br />
by sponsors Alfresco, Atlassian, IBM, and MaestroDev.</p>

<p>About The Apache<br />
Software Foundation (ASF)<br />Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation<br />
oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache<br />
HTTP Server &mdash; the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's<br />
meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 300 individual Members<br />
and 2,500 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available<br />
enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of<br />
software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community<br />
actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and<br />
ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The<br />
ASF is funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including AMD,<br />
Basis Technology, Facebook, Google, IBM, HP, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft,<br />
SpringSource/VMware, and Yahoo!. For more information, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>.</p>
