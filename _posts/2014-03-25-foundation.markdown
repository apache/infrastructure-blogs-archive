  <div>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich APIs for managing the compute, networking, software, and storage infrastructure resources. CloudStack became an Apache Top-level Project (TLP) in March 2013.</div> 
  <p>&quot;We are proud to announce CloudStack v4.3,&quot; said Hugo Trippaers, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. &quot;This release represents over six months of work from the Apache CloudStack community with many new and improved features.&quot;</p>
