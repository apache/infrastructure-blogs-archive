    \r\n(as it is a specific 5.11.2 parcel, but what about cdh 5.13, 5.14, etc?) "

  content: "Hi Alexander.\r\n\r\nThe plan is expanding support to other CDH versions
    for next releases of Apache Phoenix. We are still on the process of deciding what
    is the best approach to ensure maximum parcel compatibility. We are thinking in
    several options:\r\n\r\n(A) Releasing one single parcel generated with wider compatibility
    ( cloudera-labs phoenix style ) . The issue here is that all transitive dependencies
    packaged in phoenix fatjars would be specific to a certain cdh version (i.e. cdh
    5.11.2) but would be running against a different cdh version (maybe cdh5.14.0)
    . There is a small chance of incompatibility across versions ( even when all of
    them are HBase 1.2 based ) . Also we wouldn't be running our IT against all these
    cdh versions. \r\n\r\n(B) Release several parcels specific to different cdh versions.
    That is the safest option for better compatibility as we would be shipping the
    exact same libraries in the parcel as used in that version of cdh. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  content: "Hi I have notices that there seems to be an issue with the Parcel. To
    be specific with this artifact:\r\n\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.apache.phoenix</groupId>\r\n
    \   <artifactId>phoenix-spark</artifactId>\r\n    <version>4.13.2-cdh5.11.2</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\nThe
    following will break:\r\n\r\n1) spark shell with the phoenix-spark jar\r\n2) import
    org.apache.phoenix.spark._\r\n3) new ToDataFrameFunctions(null)\r\n4) this will
    result in a noSuchMethodException on the constructor for DataFrameFunctions\r\n\r\nThis
    can also be observed in other constellations as when using saveToPhoenix functionality
    on DataFrames."

  content: 'Hi Pedro:  Re - CDH version support.  We''ve been struggling with this
    exact issue testing your release on our CDH 5.12.1.  I ended up having to  patch
    phoenix-client to generate a client-minimal.jar, then wrangle with classpath settings
    and Oozie sharelib to get around Cloudera Hadoop changes between 5.11 and 5.12.  Please
    see my mirror https://github.com/chinogitano/apache_phoenix/tree/4.13-cdh5.11.2
    for details.  Thanks again!'

  content: Hi, Apache Phoenix 4.13.2 is only compatible with CDH 5.11.2 - you may
    have noticed it when trying to install the parcel - . Next version 4.14 will have
    parcels specific for CDH 5.11, 5.12, 5.13 & 5.14  - we are in the process of closing
    a release - . For future queries can you please use our email lists? Thanks!

  content: Thanks Pedro.  I tried multiple times to subscribe to the mailing list
    (*not* archive), but all ignored.  Therefore I am unable to post my full writeup.  Can
    you point me to another forum or someone who can help?  Should I just file a pull
    request?
