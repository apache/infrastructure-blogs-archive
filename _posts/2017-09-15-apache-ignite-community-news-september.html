  content: Apache Ignite is an open-source disseminated database. I have used Apache
    server before for my semester project of some academic website https://www.gulfwriter.com/
    and there was a lot to learn. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It is the most
    widely used server software.

<p><b></i>by Tom Diederich</i></b></p>
<p>This is our third community update &ndash; there&rsquo;s a lot going on, so let's get started.</p>
<p>Apache Ignite experts have already spoken at two meetups this month, both in Silicon Valley, but there are several more scheduled this month around the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:15.0pt"><span style="line-height:19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><span style="color:#333333">On <b>Sept. 9</b> Apache Ignite PMC chair Denis Magda was the featured presenter at the<b> </b><a href="https://www.meetup.com/datariders/events/242523245/"><b><span style="color:#467d76">Big Data and Cloud Meetup</span></b></a> in Santa Clara, Calif. His talk, titled "Apache Spark and Apache Ignite: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT," was highly rated and we&rsquo;re planning a hands-on workshop with meetup organizers for November.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:15.0pt"><span style="line-height:19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><span style="color:#333333">On <b>Sept. 13</b> Denis also spoke at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SF-Big-Analytics/events/242368299/"><b><span style="color:#467d76">SF Big Analytics Meetup</span></b></a> in Mountain View, Calif. Again, to a packed room. The topic of his talk was "Better Machine Learning with Apache Ignite."</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:15.0pt"><span style="line-height:19.5pt"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><span style="color:#333333">But Denis isn&rsquo;t having all the fun &ndash; next Monday <i>(Sept. 18)</i>, technology evangelist Akmal Chaudhri will speak at the Cambridge .NET User Group. The title of his talk: "<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NET-User-Group/events/238837204/"><b><span style="color:#467d76">Scale Out and Conquer: Apache Ignite for .NET Users</span></b></a>."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">We&rsquo;re still looking for more meetups to speak at this month, so if you&rsquo;re an organizer or would like us to speak at one you&rsquo;re a member of, just let me know. In the meantime, here are the meetups planned for the remainder of September:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/Bay-Area-In-Memory-Computing/events/242961495">Bay Area In-Memory Computing Meetup</a>, Wednesday, Sept. 20 &ndash; Denis will present, "Apache Spark, Ignite and Flink: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT."</span></span></li>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/IoT-NY">Internet of Things (IoT) New York Meetup</a>, Monday, Sept. 25 &ndash; Akmal will present, "Apache Spark and Apache Ignite: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT." </span></span></li>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/NYC-In-Memory-Computing-Meetup/events/243150945">NYC In-Memory Computing Meetup</a>, Tuesday, Sept. 26 &ndash; Akmal will present, "Powering Up Banks and Financial Institutions with Distributed Systems." </span></span></li>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/preview/New-York-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/242597746">New York Kubernetes Meetup</a>, Wednesday, Sept. 27 &ndash; Akmal will provide a DevOps perspective on the orchestration of distributed databases and Apache Ignite.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">See? I told you Denis wasn&rsquo;t having all the fun! Akmal is definitely on the road again. </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="font-family:Helvetica">Webinars</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="http://bigcommunity.net/big-tv/">Implementing In-Memory Computing for Financial Services Use Cases with Apache Ignite</a> Sept 12 <i>(recording available)</i></span></span></li>
<li><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Helvetica"><a href="https://www.gridgain.com/company/news/events/better-machine-learning-with-apacher-ignitetm">Better Machine Learning with Apache Ignite</a>, Wednesday, Sept. 27</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b><span style="font-family:Helvetica">Blog posts</span></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">On Sept. 5, Akmal published &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/using-java-and-net-apps-connect-apache-ignite-cluster">Using Java and .NET apps to connect to an Apache Ignite cluster</a>, that details how to create an Apache Ignite cluster that can support the reading and writing of user-defined objects in a common storage format. This is particularly useful in situations where applications need to work with objects but these objects will be accessed by different programming languages and frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">On Sept. 7, Dmitriy Setrakyan published &ldquo;<a href="http://gridgain.blogspot.com/2017/09/apache-ignite-in-memory-performance.html">Apache Ignite - In Memory Performance with Durability of Disk.&rdquo;</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">Next up, on Sept. 12, was Akmal, who published &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/kubernetes-and-apacher-ignitetm-deployment-aws">Kubernetes and Apache&reg; Ignite&trade; Deployment on AWS</a>.&rdquo; That post walked through the steps required to get Kubernetes and Apache Ignite deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">And then on Sept. 13 Dmitriy published &ldquo;<a href="http://gridgain.blogspot.com/2017/09/what-is-apache-ignite.html">What is Apache Ignite</a>.&rdquo; I think the headline of that one is self-explanatory. </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="font-family:Helvetica">In the news</span></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica">Nikita Ivanov is also an InfoWorld contributor.
