<p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Hi folks,</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"></p>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">
<div>I'm delighted to announce that J&ouml;rg Rade has been voted in as a committer for Apache Isis, and also as a member of the Apache Isis PMC.&nbsp; The first gives J&ouml;rg the right to commit changes directly to Isis' codebase, the second gives him the right to be involved in future votes.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>J&ouml;rg has been active in the community for more than five years, and has been actively been developing a new viewer for the framework, called "Kroviz" .&nbsp; This runs against the REST API provided by the Restful Objects viewer, and is implemented in Kotlin (running in the browser as KotlinJS).&nbsp; I'm delighted to say that J&ouml;rg will be donating this codebase to the framework and will continue to develop it within our new "incubator".</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>J&ouml;rg is also very visible on our new Slack channel (he's been sharing the status on Kroviz there for quite a while) so if you want to ping him and ask him questions about this new viewer, I'm sure he'd be very willing&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I'm looking forward to continue working with J&ouml;rg in the future; another great addition to Isis' committers.</div>
