<div><b><i>Leading Open Source office application and personal productivity suite for Windows, Mac, and Linux reaches a major adoption milestone</i></b></div>
<div><b><br />17 April 2014 --Forest Hill, MD--</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 170 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache OpenOffice&trade; has been downloaded 100 million times.</div>
<div>Apache OpenOffice is the leading Open Source office document productivity suite, available in 32 languages on Windows, OS X, and Linux. OpenOffice includes a word processor ("Writer"), a spreadsheet ("Calc"), a presentation editor ("Impress"), a vector graphics editor ("Draw"), a mathematical formula editor ("Math"), and a database management program ("Base"). &nbsp;As Open Source software, Apache OpenOffice is available to all users free of charge; the C++ source code is readily available for anyone who wishes to enhance the applications.</div>
<div>Originally created as "StarOffice" by StarDivision and after further development as an Open Source product under the name "OpenOffice.org", OpenOffice entered the Apache Incubator in 2011 and graduated as an Apache Top-level Project in October 2012.</div>
<div>"I'm extremely pleased to see us reach this major milestone in less than two years," said Andrea Pescetti, Vice President of Apache OpenOffice. "This is a testament to our community volunteers: the hundreds of talented individuals who make Apache OpenOffice what it is, who write the code, test for bugs, translate the user interface, write documentation, answer user questions and manage our servers. We remain committed to offering the successful combination of reliability and innovation that so many users appreciate."</div>
<div>Official downloads at openoffice.org are hosted by SourceForge, where users can also find repositories for more than 750 extensions and over 2,800 templates for OpenOffice.</div>
<div>"By continuously improving Apache OpenOffice Extensions and Templates sites we show how committed we are about providing projects with what they need most," said Gaurav Kuchhal, General Manager for Slashdot and SourceForge. "We are happy to help open source projects to grow, no matter where they are hosted or developed. We have been serving over 122 Million downloads for the Apache OpenOffice project, with daily peaks of about 250,000 and we are committed to providing products and services that demonstrate our dedication to technical excellence."</div>
<div>"Apache OpenOffice reaching 100 million downloads is a remarkable achievement in the project's 29-year history and testament to the power of successful Open Source communities," said Shane Curcuru, Apache OpenOffice mentor and ASF Vice President of Brand Management. "We extend our gratitude to all the volunteers and users whose contribution, feedback, support, engagement, and enthusiasm keeps us focused on delivering great software. We couldn't celebrate this milestone without them!"</div>
