In a previous post, we announce the Apache TomEE logo contest.
The purpose is to find a logo that clearly fits the logo philosophy and would allow everybody to identify it.

We already got interesting proposals and decided to extend the logo contest till January, 15th.
Every proposal is welcome and there is no limit!
