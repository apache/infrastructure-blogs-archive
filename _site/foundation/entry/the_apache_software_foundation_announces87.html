Arrow solves this problem by enabling data to be shared between systems and processes with no serialization, deserialization or memory copies. &quot;An industry-standard columnar in-memory data layer enables users to combine multiple systems, applications and programming languages in a single workload without the usual overhead,&quot; said Ted Dunning, Vice President of the Apache Incubator and member of the Apache Arrow Project Management Committee. In addition to traditional relational data, Arrow supports complex data with dynamic schemas. For example, Arrow can handle JSON data which is commonly used in IoT workloads, modern applications and log files. Implementations are also available (or underway) for a number of programming languages including Java, C++ and Python to allow greater interoperability among a number of Big Data solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &quot;Real world use cases often include complex combinations of structured and rapidly growing complex-data.
