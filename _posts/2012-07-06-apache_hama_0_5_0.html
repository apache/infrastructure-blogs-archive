<p>The Apache Hama PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Hama 0.5.0.</p>
<p>Apache Hama is a BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing framework<br />
on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for massive scientific<br />
computations such as matrix, graph and network algorithms.</p>
<p>This release is the first release as a top level project, contains two<br />
significant new features (Message Compressor, complete clone of the<br />
Google's Pregel) and many improvements for computing system<br />
performance and durability.</p>
<p>The artifacts are published and ready for you to download[1] either<br />
from the Apache mirrors or from the Maven repository. For more<br />
details, please take a look at our website[2] and wiki[3].</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Hama community for making this release possible.</p>
