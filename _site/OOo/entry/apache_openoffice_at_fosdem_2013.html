Apache OpenOffice has a dedicated track (devroom) on Saturday 2 February, all day. The devroom schedule includes talks from experienced full-time developers and new volunteers, spanning all development-related topics around OpenOffice: deep technical previews and live demos of what is coming in version 4.0, tutorials on scripting and programming Apache OpenOffice, development-related use cases and tips and tricks for developers of extensions and writing aids. Hackers who want to test their skills on OpenOffice shouldn&#39;t miss the Hacking Apache OpenOffice session, where experienced professional and volunteer OpenOffice developers will give advice on the best ways to get started. And the next step will be to tackle one of our easy or simple development tasks... If you are interested in knowing more on Apache OpenOffice and the plans for version 4.0, just drop by the Apache OpenOffice stand. Volunteers will be there all day on both Saturday 2 February and Sunday 3 February. See you in Brussels!
