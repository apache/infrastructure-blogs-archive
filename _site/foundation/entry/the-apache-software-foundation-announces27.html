<meta name="description" content="Mature Big Data database management system for working in SQL at Apache Hadoop-scale levels in use China Mobile, China Unicom, Dell EMC, Esgyn Corporation, and Millersoft Limited, among others. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;10 January 2018&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Trafodion&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. Apache Trafodion extends Apache Hadoop to guarantee transactional integrity and operational workloads for new kinds of Big Data applications that run on Hadoop. &nbsp;&quot;We are very excited to have been established as an Apache Top-Level Project,&quot; said Pierre Smits, Vice President of Apache Trafodion. &quot;Graduation is a terrific milestone that culminates 2.5 years of contributions from around the globe to establishing a growing community committed to delivering a high-grade OLTP solution on top of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; Building on the scalability, elasticity, and flexibility of Hadoop, Trafodion (meaning &quot;transactions&quot; in Welsh) is the first integrated Open Source solution that delivers on the promise of integrated transactional and analytical systems (OLTP/OLAP) for Apache Hadoop. Trafodion&#39;s features include: Fully functional ANSI SQL support, leveraging existing SQL skills; Distributed ACID data protection, guaranteeing data consistency across multiple tables and rows; Compile-Time and Run-Time Optimizers, delivering performance improvements for OLTP workloads; Parallel-aware Query Optimizer, supporting large data sets; Apache Spark integration, supporting streaming analysis; Interoperability with existing Apache Hadoop tools and solutions, such as Hive, Ambari, Flume, Kafka, and Oozie; and&nbsp; Apache Hadoop and Linux distribution neutrality. Trafodion originated at HP-IT in 2013, and was donated to the Apache Incubator in May 2015. The project has had four official releases since entering the Apache Incubator.&nbsp; Apache Trafodion is in use at China Mobile, China Unicom, Dell EMC, Esgyn Corporation, and Millersoft Limited, among others. &quot;As a member of the HP Core Team responsible for releasing Trafodion to The Apache Software Foundation, and responsible for the project&rsquo;s name, I&#39;m thrilled to see the Trafodion community be recognized with this major achievement.

It will give Millersoft the confidence to introduce the technology to our Big Data clients,&quot; said Calum Miller, Director of Millersoft Limited. &quot;Testing of our Open Source Data Vault engine running on top of Apache Trafodion is going well and we look forward to announcing a fully integrated product shortly.&quot; &quot;Apache Trafodion enhanced the operational efficiency of our Big Data platforms, and brought us better customer experience and broader application scenarios,&quot; said Charles Yu, Managing Director, Application Services at Dell EMC. &quot;Congratulations to Trafodion for officially becoming part of the Apache open source ecosystem,&quot; said Qingquan Gu, Senior Development Engineer of Internet of Things Marketing Service Center at China Unicom. &quot;Using Trafodion provided China Unicom with the ability to build and integrate Big Data platforms, enhanced our operational efficiency, and brought us better customer experience.&quot; &quot;Becoming an Apache Top-Level Project is only the beginning,&quot; added Smits. &quot;We are looking forward to growing the Trafodion community, reaching new adopters and contributors, and fostering a strong ecosystem around the project.&quot; Availability and OversightApache Trafodion software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.
