<meta name="description" content="We finally made this happen! I&rsquo;m happy to invite all of the software architects and engineers out there to a series of webinars that will introduce you to the fundamental capabilities of in-memory computing platforms such as Apache Ignite. There will also be a mix of theory and practice. A lot of code examples are waiting to be shown so that you can apply the theory in practice right away. The series consists of two parts. Part 1: Tuesday, November 21, 2017, 11:00am PT / 2:00pm ET To be covered: Cluster configuration and deployment. Distributed database internals (partitioning, replication). Data processing with key-value APIs. Affinity Collocation. Data processing with SQL. Part 2: Wednesday, December 13, 2017, 11:00am PT / 2:00pm ET To be covered: Collocated processing. Collocated processing for distributed computations. Collocated processing for SQL (distributed joins and more). Machine Learning. Memory Architecture. Book your seat!" />
