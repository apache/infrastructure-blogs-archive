<meta name="description" content="&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Once again the Apache Software Foundation is a &quot;mentoring organization&quot; in Google Summer of Code, and the Apache OpenOffice project looks forward to this year&#39;s program.&nbsp; We invite students looking to get their hands dirty with real-world code to consider submitting an GSoC application related to OpenOffice.&nbsp; Why OpenOffice? We&#39;re one of the most famous open source projects around.&nbsp; Our latest release has had over 45 million downloads.&nbsp; The work you do with OpenOffice could be seen by millions of users. We&#39;re a fun, international and diverse group of volunteers.&nbsp; Working with OpenOffice this summer will be fun. The core code for OpenOffice is C++, but extensions can be written in Java, Python and Basic as well.&nbsp; We probably speak your language. OpenOffice software is central to the daily work of its users, with text documents, spreadsheets and presentations.&nbsp; There are good opportunities to explore applications that connect OpenOffice to cutting-edge disciplines such as text analytics, natural language processing, social network analysis, the semantic web, etc. We&#39;ve posted some initial ideas, suggested by our mentors.&nbsp; But don&#39;t feel limited to these ideas.&nbsp; If you want to work on a variation of one of these ideas, or an entirely different idea, let us know.&nbsp; If it is a good fit, and a mentor is able to work with you, then let us know.&nbsp; If you&#39;re passionate about something we want to hear about it. For more information, please take a look at the Apache-wide GSoC page where many of your questions may be already answered. Finally, we highly encourage prospective applicants to engage early with the OpenOffice community on our development mailing list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
