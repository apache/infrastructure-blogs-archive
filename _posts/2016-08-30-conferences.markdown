<div>It's traditional. We wait for the last minute to get our talk proposals in for conferences.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>Well, the last minute has arrived. The CFP for ApacheCon Seville closes on September 9th, which is less than 2 weeks away. It's time to get your talks in, so that we can make this the best ApacheCon yet.</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>It's also time to discuss with your developer and user community whether there's a track of talks that you might want to propose, so that you have more complete coverage of your project than a talk or two.</div>

  <div>This year, we'll be reviewing papers &quot;blind&quot; - that is, looking at the abstracts without knowing who the speaker is. This has been shown to eliminate the &quot;me and my buddies&quot; nature of many tech conferences, producing more diversity, and more new speakers. So make sure your abstracts clearly explain what you'll be talking about.</div>
