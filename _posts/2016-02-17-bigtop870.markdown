On behalf of the Apache Bigtop team, I'd love to announce the general availability of the Bigtop 1.1.0 release.<br /><br />A few highlights of this release include:<br /> 
  <ul> 
    <li>five different operating systems are supported</li> 
    <li>a brand new ppc64le architecture was added to the support matrix</li> 
    <li>most stable Hadoop 2.7.1 is used</li> 
    <li>new data notebooks project Zeppelin (incubating)</li> 
    <li>addition of Apache Hama</li> 
    <li>toolchain is updated to the latest versions of the development tools</li> 
    <li>standard docker containers are available for builds, testing, and alike</li> 
    <li>on-going improvements in the unattended cluster deployment and testing</li> 
    <li>improvements in the smoke-tests coverage and UX</li> 
    <li>and many upgrades to the latest versions of the ecosystem projects<br />(Crunch, Flume, Ignite, Hive, Mahout, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Spark, and many others)<br /></li> 
  </ul>With Bigtop 1.1 the community continues on the path of delivering the most advanced, openly-developer data analytics stack to date. This is a true bigtop project, bringing together virtually all of the Apache Software Foundation data processing projects.<br />This release of the Apache Bigdata platform include close to 260 bug fixes and new features.<br /><br />Deploying Bigtop is easy: grab the repo/list file for your favorite Linux distribution:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.apache.org/dist/bigtop/bigtop-1.1.0/repos/<br />and you'll be running your very own bigdata cluster in no time!<br />Alternatively, you can use Bigtop provisioner to spin-up a virtual cluster with a single command as explained in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Bigtop+Provisioner+User+Guide<br /><br />I want to emphasize the great work done by the project contributors, and thank everyone in this and other communities who made this release possible!<br /><br />
