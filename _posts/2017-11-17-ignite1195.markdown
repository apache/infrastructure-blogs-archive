We finally made this happen! Iâ€™m happy to invite all of the software architects and engineers out there to a series of webinars that will introduce you to the fundamental capabilities of in-memory computing platforms such as Apache Ignite.

<p>
There will also be a mix of theory and practice. A lot of code examples are waiting to be shown so that you can apply the theory in practice right away.
</p>

<p>
The series consists of two parts.
