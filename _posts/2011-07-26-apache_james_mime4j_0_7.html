<p>The Apache James Project is happy to announce<br />
           the release of version 0.7 of the Apache James Mime4j.</p>
<p>Mime4j is a flexible MIME parsing library written in Java. SAX, DOM and pull parsing styles are<br />
            supported.</p>
<p>The 0.7 release brings another round of API enhancements, bug fixes and performance optimizations.<br />
            A major effort has been put in code reorganization, separating parsing code from DOM manipulation<br />
            code. Mime4J has been restructured into three separate modules: 'core', 'dom' and 'storage'.<br />
            The 'core' package provides an event-driven SAX style parser that relies on a callback mechanism<br />
            to report parsing events such as the start of an entity header the start of a body, etc.<br />
            The 'dom' package contains base/abstract classes and interfaces for MIME-DOM manipulation aiming<br />
            to provide the base for a full featured traversable DOM. Per default the Mime4J DOM builder stores<br />
            content of individual body parts in memory. The 'storage' package provides support for more<br />
            complex storage backends such on-disk storage systems, overflow on max limit, or encrypted storage<br />
            through JSSE API.</p>
<p>Mime4j 0.7 improves support for headless messages, malformed separation between headers and body<br />
            and adds support for "obsolete" rfc822 syntax (e.g: "Header<somespace>: " style). Parsing<br />
            performance for quoted printable streams have been considerably improved. A "DecodeMonitor" object<br />
            has been introduced in most code to define how to deal with malformed input (Lenient vs Strict<br />
            behaviours). Mime4j 0.7 also provides LenientFieldParser as an alternative to DefaultFieldParser<br />
            when a higher degree of tolerance to non-severe MIME field format violations is desired.</p>
