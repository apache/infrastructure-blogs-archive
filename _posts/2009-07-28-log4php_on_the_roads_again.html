<p>Some of you might have noticed it: log4php is on the road again. After quite a long break there is ongoing effort on creating a new release of this logging API. Meanwhile we have ported most of the code to PHP5 and are working hard on updating the website, which is a bit outdated currently.</p>
<p>However, helpful hands are always welcome. Please join the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/mail-lists.html">developers list</a> if you have some cycles left.</p>
