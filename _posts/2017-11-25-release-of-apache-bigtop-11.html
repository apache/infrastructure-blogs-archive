<div>On behalf of the Apache Bigtop team, I'd love to announce the general availability of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/bigtop/bigtop-1.2.1/">Bigtop 1.2.1</a> release.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A few highlights of the 1.2 series release include:</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; 6 Distros, 2 archs(x86 and ppc64le) supported</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; A newly introduced Bigtop Sandbox feature, which brings you the best Big Data experience</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; A faster Docker Provisioner which is rewritten to fully embrace Docker ecosystem</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; OpenJDK 8 support. Yes, all components are built on JDK8</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; Hadoop 2.7.3, Spark 2.1.1, HBase 1.1.9, and Zeppelin 0.72 are used</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull; and many upgrades of the ecosystem projects<br />(Apex, Crunch, Flume, Ignite, Mahout, Oozie, Phoenix, and many others)</div>
<div>
<p>With Bigtop 1.2.1 the community continues to deliver the most advanced big data stack to date. More details:&nbsp;<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Bigtop+1.2.1+Release">BIgtop 1.2.1 Release</a></p>
<p>Deploying Bigtop is easy: grab the repo/list file for your favorite Linux distribution:<br />&nbsp; https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/bigtop/bigtop-1.2.1/repos/<br />and you'll be running your very own bigdata cluster in no time!</p>
</p></div>
<div>Alternatively, you can use Bigtop Provisioner to spin-up a virtual cluster with a single command as explained in&nbsp;<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Bigtop+Provisioner+User+Guide">Bigtop Provisioner User Guide</a></div>
<div>Finally, I encourage everyone to give our brand new feature Bigtop Sandbox a try:&nbsp;<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70256303">How to build and run Bigtop Sandbox (Experimental)</a>&nbsp;Feedback is welcome!</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I want to emphasize that this is a collaborative work done by project contributors and other communities, who continue to devote time to make Bigtop a better software. Thank you all for making this release possible!</div>
