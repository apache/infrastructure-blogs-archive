<meta name="description" content="Second annual Get-Together. No fees no conference and no sessions. Just an excuse to get-together, code, and have a beer or two. Hacking Monday - Thursday. Friday and the weekend is for non-technical fun. Tech-time will likely be focusing on TomEE, Java EE 6 Web Profile and OSGi hacking. If you have something you&#39;ve been wanting to work on, come on down and I&#39;m sure someone will be available to give you some pointers and get you rolling. Even if you just know you want to work on something but don&#39;t know what, I&#39;m sure we can find a nice little project for you. Even the smallest task has a way of taking you in unexpected and fun directions. Most of us are staying here: http://www.hotel-ronsard.com A good second choice: http://www.hoteldeschateaux.fr Jean-Louis&#39; company, Atos Origin, has graciously offered space for daytime hacking fun. Please rsvp to him if you wish to partake as he will need to get you a security badge. His apache address is jlmonteiro@. I&#39;ve heard rumors of a limited supply of food and coffee on the premises for those that rsvp. So definitely get word to JL! Evening fun will likely be around the center of Tours. I&#39;ll try and twitter our locations, facebook checkin and am happy to give out my cell and google voice to anyone who would love to happen by for a beer. Just email me offline. There are likely some neat social networking tools we could use, feel free to suggest one. Hope to see you there!" />
