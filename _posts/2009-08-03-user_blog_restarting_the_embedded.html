<p>Jonas Bandi writes in his CLOSED-LOOP blog a nice entry on <a href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2009/06/restarting-embedded-openejb-container.html">Restarting the embedded OpenEJB container between each test</a>.  Jonas documents the use of a newer property "openejb.embedded.initialcontext.close" which allows you to destroy the embedded container system after each test.</p>
<p>Note that Maven users can use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/forking.html">Surefire Forking</a> to achieve a similar result that will also clear out any embedded database state as well.  That approach basically gives you a fresh VM for every test and the approach we use internally in our build.  Haven't done any speed comparisons to see how they stack up speed wise.</p>
