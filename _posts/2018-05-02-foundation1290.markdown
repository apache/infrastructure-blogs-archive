  <div>When the ASF incorporated in 1999, its core membership comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group grew with Committers --developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership:</div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>to &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; (contribute) directly to the code repository;</li> 
    <li>the right to vote on community-related decisions; and</li> 
    <li>the ability propose an active user for Committership.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <div>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation's growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/members.html">existing Members</a>.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>This election brings the total number of ASF Members to 731 today. Individuals elected as ASF Members legally serve as the &quot;shareholders&quot; of the Foundation <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html">https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/members.html</a></div>
