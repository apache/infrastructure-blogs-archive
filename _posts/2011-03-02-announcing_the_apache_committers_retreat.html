<p>We are&nbsp;pleased to announce the 2nd Apache Retreat at Knockree in Ireland, running 13th-16th May. As part of this event, we're running a BarCamp un-conference, and we'd love for&nbsp;members of the Apache community at-large&nbsp;to join us on Saturday 14th May.</p>
<p><u>For&nbsp;Apache code&nbsp;committers</u>: we're hoping you'll be able to join us for the whole weekend; please see the website for details&nbsp;on&nbsp;the programme&nbsp;for&nbsp;those attending the full event.</p>
<p><u>For Apache software users/developers/enthusiasts</u>: we'd love for you to come along in the day on the Saturday. We're running a BarCamp in the day, and it'll be great chance to learn more about new Apache projects, how the Apache Way leads us to develop software, as well as to talk about your current projects.</p>
<p>More details on the event, transport details, and a link to the signup site are available from:<br />

<p>We're looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible at the BarCamp in May!</p>
