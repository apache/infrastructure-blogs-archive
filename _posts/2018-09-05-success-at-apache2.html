<p><strong><em>by Sally Khudairi,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>with contributions by Ignasi Barrera, Von Gosling, Luke Han, Kevin A. McGrail, and Anthony Shaw. Translations by Ted Liu and David Zhenwei Dong.</em></strong></p>
<p>I became active in The Apache Software Foundation at its inception in 1999. I am responsible for elevating the ASF's visibility, and supporting the Foundation by counseling 350+ Apache projects and their communities in the areas of messaging, outreach, and engagement.</p>
<p>As a global, virtual, and diverse community, the ASF relies on countless Apache Members, Committers, and Contributors to help share our values and explain our processes with others. We have grown from a single project to hundreds of projects and communities <a href="https://projects.apache.org/committees.html?date">https://projects.apache.org/committees.html?date</a> through "The Apache Way": an inclusive process and judicious reinforcement of "Community Over Code".&nbsp;</p>
<p>We launched the "Success at Apache" blog series following the Media &amp; Analyst Training at ApacheCon Seville in 2016. I asked ASF Board Member and VP Brand Management Mark Thomas his opinion on what he thinks are some of the reasons that the ASF "just works". His immediate response was: "project independence". I asked if he'd put that in writing &mdash;in his own words&mdash; as our community members' personal experiences help others see The Apache Way through their unique perspectives. Shortly afterwards, we published "Project Independence" <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success_at_apache_project_independence">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success_at_apache_project_independence</a>&nbsp;and "Success at Apache" was born <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/feed/entries/atom?cat=SuccessAtApache">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/feed/entries/atom?cat=SuccessAtApache</a> .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst English is the ASF's official language, localization often helps foster understanding,&nbsp; encourage adoption, and onboard new contributors more quickly. A while back, ASF Member Ted Liu told me that he and some of his coworkers had translated a handful of our "Success at Apache" blog posts into Mandarin Chinese. He asked if it would be useful to us.</p>
<p>Why yes, of course: new approaches to promote and propagate The Apache Way are always appreciated.</p></p>

<p>Ted's action reflects one of our greatest successes at Apache: the mindset of "If this is helpful to me, that's good (= "scratch your own itch"). If it helps others, all the better."&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, we didn't become the world's largest Open Source foundation by not being helpful. There's always something needing to be done in an all-volunteer community: if you'd like to help the ASF, we will happily accept your assistance where possible. Plus, helping others feels pretty great.</p>
<p>Whether contributing code and writing documentation <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html">http://apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html</a> , mentoring community members <a href="http://community.apache.org/">http://community.apache.org/</a> , supporting the ASF through an individual donation or corporate sponsorship <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html">http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html</a> , or serving in myriad other ways <a href="https://helpwanted.apache.org/">https://helpwanted.apache.org/</a> , we thank you.</p>
