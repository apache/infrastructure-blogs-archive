  content: "I have installed the beta, and will be testing both with jaws and Nvda.
    It will be hard to know if accessibility problems is caused by mistakes in Open
    Office or Jaws or Nvda is we need a way to discuss experiences that may be more
    related to screen reader users than general Open Office problems.\r\n"

  content: "I like open office I like the fact it is free because I live on a pension
    and can't afford other programs.\r\nI like how it works, ease of use. All the
    things you can add to the program. User friendly works like a charm each and every
    time I use it."

  content: "I just spent 2 hours trialing the beta in half screen with 4.01 open in
    the other half screen. Can't tell the difference between the two. Things that
    seem obvious but never get changed:\r\n\r\nMore fonts. More clipart. Search function
    for clip art. Higher quality looking UI. I offer Open Office to every college
    student who comes through my office and they always say the same thing: it looks
    cheap - I don't trust it not to crash and lose my work. \r\n\r\nI've used Open
    Office for 6 years and I know it is stable and has awesome recovery features...
    but for some reason the interface never seems to look high quality. \r\n\r\nMy
    suggestion: Find graphic designers to overhaul every icon, create new fonts, and
    develop more clipart. Take a break from trying to compete with features available
    in MS Office and look the part.\r\n\r\nAwesome software. Works AMAZING. Just doesn't
    look the part.\r\n"

  content: "Need to simplify the package.  Siphon off apps like Base into an Add-On
    Package.  Remove Java Dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere is too much junk in this Office
    Suite that is not easily disablable or easy to avoid installing.  Still too much
    stuff is dependent on Java.  Should have some sort of option to OMIT Java-dependent
    components.\r\n\r\nStill paying for office by the month because the OpenOfffice
    Installer and Apps is not so great and still depends on Java for stuff, and LibreOffice
    can't even open a file without crashing on my PC."

  content: I save a lot of Writer files in doc format.  Currently, I have access only
    to obsolete versions of Word.  I hope 4.1 will give me access to later versions.

  content: I installled the 4.1 beta on a new HP Envy 17 touchsmart 12 GB RAM and
    1TB HDD running Windows 8.1 x64 .   After installation it shows up on the Desktop
    and I pinned it to the Start screen where I moved the tile to a convenient location,  But
    when I tapped the tile to open it all that happened was a very fast flash midscreen
    and a change to the Desktop screen.   No sign of AOO 4.1.   I tried it again using
    the icon on the Desktop and again got just a half second or less flash of an opening
    window for AOO.  I will try to install AOO 4.0.1 on this computer and see how
    it behaves.

<p>We release Beta versions of OpenOffice to get early feedback from users. &nbsp;Beta versions may have more bugs than our final <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_availability#General_availability_.28GA.29">GA</a> releases and may not be suitable for tasks which require the highest level of stability. Beta versions are recommended for experienced users who are willing to share their feedback with the OpenOffice project. </p>
<p>The 4.1.0 Beta features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X version is now 64-bit and requires OS X version 10.7 or above.</li>
<li>Integrated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAccessible2">iAccessible2</a> support, offering better integration with screen readers. </li>
<li>Annotations of text ranges in Writer.</li>
<li>In-place editing of text fields in Writer.</li>
<li>Interactive image crop feature for Impress and Draw.</li>
<li>Enhanced support for 3D charts.</li>
<li>New language translations:&nbsp; Bulgarian, Danish, Hindi, Norwegian Bokm&aring;l and Thai.</li>
<li>Many bug fixes and smaller improvements as detailed in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
