<meta name="description" content="Open Source Big Data in-memory data grid used by hundreds of enterprises to power mission-critical low latency, high concurrency transactional applications at extreme scale. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;21 November 2016&mdash;&nbsp;The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Geode&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. Apache Geode is an Open Source in-memory data grid that provides transactional data management for scale-out applications needing low latency response times during high concurrent processing. &quot;Graduating as a Top-Level Project marks an important milestone for Apache Geode,&quot; said Mark Bretl, Vice President of Apache Geode. &quot;Our community is proud to champion a diverse group of developers and users whose support has helped Geode reach a sustainable level of maturity.&quot; The Geode codebase was originally developed by Gemstone Systems in 2002. GemFire, the original commercial distribution of Geode, was first widely adopted by the financial sector as the transactional, low-latency data engine used in Wall Street trading platforms. Pivotal&reg;, which owns the GemFire technology, submitted the Geode code to the Apache Incubator in April 2015. &quot;We are excited to see Geode graduate from the Apache Incubator to a Top-Level Project. It&#39;s quite a feat to transform a mature commercial product into a widely adopted open source project,&quot; said Elisabeth Hendrickson, VP of Big Data R&amp;D at Pivotal. &quot;The committers in Geode have worked hard at building community and making the project accessible to newcomers, paving the way for developers everywhere to benefit from a proven in memory data grid technology.&quot; Since entering the Apache Incubator, the project has had significant increases in the number of independent developers contributing to the code, as well as organizations incorporating Apache Geode in their deployments and solutions. Today, over 600 enterprises use the technology behind Apache Geode for high-scale business applications that must meet low latency and 24x7 availability requirements, such as financial risk analysis systems, high volume eCommerce Websites, and transportation &amp; logistics management. &quot;zData has been deploying big solutions with the technology of Apache Geode well before it became open source software. We look forward to helping more of our customers enjoy the speed, reliability, and scale that Apache Geode brings to any application architecture.&quot; -- Dillon Woods, CTO, zData Inc. &quot;Apache Geode is an important component of Capgemini&#39;s Business Data Lake and fast reacting business scale out analytics solutions. Capgemini congratulates the Apache Geode community on becoming a top level project in The Apache Software Foundation.&quot;&nbsp; -- Steve Jones, Global Vice President, Big Data, Capgemini &quot;Apache Apex provides direct support for Apache Geode. Geode helps Apex deployments by providing fast, fault-tolerant storage and query support for stream processing data. Data Torrent welcomes Apache Geode as a peer project of Apache Apex&quot;. --Amol Kekre, CTO at Data Torrent &quot;Apache Geode is an important component of Ampool Active Data Store. It provides scale-out in-memory processing with transactional consistency. We&#39;ve been enthusiastic users of Apache Geode since its beginning, and look forward to this next phase&quot;. -- Milind Bhandarkar, CEO at Ampool &quot;Through the incubation process we have worked to create an open and collaborative community for developers and users to work together, and look forward to seeing new contributions, feedback, bug reports, and subscribers to the Geode email lists,&quot; added Bretl. The Apache Geode project welcomes contributions and community participation through mailing lists, face-to-face MeetUps, Geode Clubhouse online, and other events such as the Apache: Big Data conference series. Availability and Oversight Apache Geode software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.

All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
