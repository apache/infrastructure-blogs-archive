<p>This was a major release and a major effort for the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Directory+of+Volunteers">many volunteers</a> who worked on coding, testing, translation, support, marketing, documentation and other aspects of the project.&nbsp; And thanks are due to ongoing support from other parts of the Apache Software Foundation, especially the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html">Apache Infrastructure Team</a> for their outsized effort to support our outsized project.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is summertime, at least for volunteers in the northern hemisphere,&nbsp; and August is vacation time.&nbsp; Many of us will be taking a break and enjoying time with friends and family.&nbsp; But then we'll be back and working at full force, with a focus on: </p>
