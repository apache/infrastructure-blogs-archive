<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">The Apache Software Foundation is happy<br />
to announce BarCampApache Sydney, Australia, the first ASF-backed event in<br />
the Southern Hemisphere!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Taking place 11th December 2010 at the<br />
University of Sydney's Darlington Centre, the BarCampApache<br />
"unconference" will be attendee-driven, facilitated by members of<br />
the Apache community and will focus on the &ldquo;Apache Way&rdquo; of<br />
developing software. The event is open to the public free of charge.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Those interested in using Apache<br />
products, how projects are developed within the ASF, open development<br />
techniques and best practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, engaging<br />
with The Apache Software Foundation, and the general BarCamp<br />
experience are welcome to participate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As the Apache community comprises<br />
thousands of committed individuals from around the world, there are<br />
always opportunities for attendees to help. And with all BarCamps,<br />
BarCampApache Sydney seeks active participation at all levels,<br />
including assisting with the physical set up to pre-event promotion<br />
to proposing discussion topics and blogging/tweeting during the<br />
event.</p>

the University of Sydney, Alfresco, IBM, and MaestroDev. Sponsorship<br />
