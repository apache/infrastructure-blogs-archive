<div><b><i>Portland, Oregon sets the stage for "Open Source Community Leadership Drives Enterprise-Grade Innovation", the theme for the 25th edition of Apache&rsquo;s popular conference series</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 2 October 2012 &ndash; </b>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced ApacheCon North America 2013. The ASF's official conference, trainings, and expo returns to North America 24 February-2 March 2013 at the Hilton Portland &amp; Executive Tower in Portland, Oregon.</div>
<div></div>
<div>ApacheCon draws Open Source users, developers, gurus, students, novices, community managers, and enthusiasts to address today's issues, opportunities, and solutions focusing on the ASF's many diverse projects and initiatives. The event takes place 24 February-2 March 2013, starting with pre-conference trainings, BarCamp, and hackathon the first two days; main conference + expo 26-28 February; followed by post-conference sprints, workshops, and team building events.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year's theme is "Open Source Community Leadership Drives Enterprise-Grade Innovation", reflecting the enormous reach of the ASF's software projects, from the ubiquitous Apache HTTP Server to dozens of initiatives in the Apache Incubator and Labs such as Allura, CloudStack, Cordova (nee Phonegap), Flex, and OpenOffice.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>The Call For Papers is now open through 5 November 2012. Early-bird registration will open 23 November 2012.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Developers and users of Apache technologies are invited to share their experiences, ideas, inspirations and knowledge. From the flagship Apache HTTP Server to Cassandra to Hadoop to Lucene/Solr to OODT to TrafficServer, Apache products power half the Internet, petabytes of data, teraflops of operations, billions of objects, and enhance the lives of countless users and developers.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ApacheCon program is created by Apache Members and Committers for the community-at-large: all content is carefully reviewed and selected by Apache Project Management Committee contributors. All those with an interest in Apache software are welcome to submit a proposal and celebrate the diversity of the projects under the Apache banner.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Who Should Attend</b></div>
<div>ApacheCon is for everyone! ASF affiliation is not required to present at, attend, or otherwise participate in ApacheCon. First held in 1999 for developers and users of the Apache Server to meet face-to-face, ApacheCon is the ASF's official conference, trainings, and expo series, and the public showcase for Apache innovations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>ApacheCon is the ideal opportunity for those currently developing Apache-based solutions, as well as those interested in committing code to an Apache project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing their Open Source products and community practices. In addition, ApacheCon is a great way to meet the individual contributors behind some of the industry's most popular Apache projects through hands-on educational sessions and ample networking opportunities.</div>
