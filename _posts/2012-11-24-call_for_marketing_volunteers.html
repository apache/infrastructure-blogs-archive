<h3>A Call for Marketing Volunteers <br /></h3>
<p>This is a call for volunteers for the Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) Marketing team.&nbsp; We have big plans for our next major release, Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp;  As our development and QA volunteers work on the engineering side of this release, we're also building up our capabilities in critical supporting functions like Marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high performance Marketing team is essential to explaining the value of OpenOffice to users worldwide.&nbsp; This work has a direct impact on the success of the OpenOffice project.&nbsp; It is also fun!</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Why volunteer?<br /></h3>
<p>Why would you want to volunteer with OpenOffice Marketing?  A few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're a fun, international group of volunteers, with a range of<br />
skills and experience, dedicated to free software and spreading the word<br />
 about OpenOffice.</li>
<li>Helping with marketing is a good way to "give back" to the open<br />
source community, something that can be done without requiring special<br />
technical skills.</li>
<li>Contributions are needed from volunteers with a range of experience levels and<br />
interests.  From copy writing to event planning to graphic design,<br />
we need volunteers in many creative and business-oriented disciplines.</li>
<li>This is a good way to learn about marketing, or one if its sub-disciplines, and gain practical experience.</li>
<li>OpenOffice is among the most recognized open source brands, up there with Linux, Android and Firefox.  Your<br />
contributions to our marketing efforts will potentially be seen by millions of users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Marketing is the set of activities our volunteers undertake to communicate<br />
the value and benefits of the OpenOffice product, as well as the OpenOffice project, to potential users and<br />
potential project members. Marketing activities within the Apache OpenOffice project include:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring and contributing to our social networking presence</li>
<li>Planning and participating at local and international conferences, giving presentations or staffing booths<br />
and answering questions about Apache OpenOffice and the project</li>
<li>Writing and reviewing project blog posts and press releases</li>
<li>Answering questions from the press, or being interviewed about the project</li>
<li>Designing new marketing collateral, such as brochures or CD cover art</li>
<li>Working as a team to refresh the product's brand and visual signature</li>
<li>Surveying users to understand their needs and concerns</li>
<li>Creating a YouTube video to show the highlights of an upcoming release</li>
<li>Working as a member of a core marketing team to enable a much larger group of volunteers and users promote<br />
OpenOffice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>
<p>You can start now, in three easy steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe to our public Marketing mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:marketing-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">marketing-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a> and respond to the confirmation email you will then receive.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself on the mailing list by sending an email to the Marketing mailing list:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:marketing@openoffice.apache.org">marketing@openoffice.apache.org</a></li>
<li>Review our self-paced <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/index.html">orientation modules</a> to help you get started.&nbsp; If you are already familiar with open source projects at Apache, then you can quickly skim over the Level 1 and Level 2 modules and concentrate on the short <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/intro-marketing.html">Introduction to Marketing</a> module.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, you are new to Apache, and want a more methodical approach to getting started, then you can start at Level 1 modules first.</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon!</p>
