<p>One of the top enterprise software packages in the world,<br />
<a href="http://ofbiz.apache.org/" title="Apache OFBiz">OFBiz</a> boasts hundreds of experienced service providers and thousands of live<br />
production instances; the framework comprises mature eCommerce, Enterprise<br />
Resource Planning, and Customer Relationship Management functionality with a<br />
general enterprise software framework and a set of base and special purpose<br />
applications. Release Branch 9.4 features numerous enterprise-grade<br />
enhancements, as well as a new time-based version system based on the date of<br />
release, similar to the Ubuntu Linux version numbers. The latest version is<br />
known as "Release9.04" because it has branched from the main code<br />
base (the "trunk") in April 2009.</p>
