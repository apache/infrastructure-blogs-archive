    using Open Office for about 6 years now. I like it and I am still learning. There
    is so much to use and it is free. Thanks for all your dedication and effort. Keep
    it up God bless you. '

  content: 'Would the Apace project management committee like to make a statement
    and in some way offer a ''peace process'' to the document foundation? I would
    love to see both these development communities work together again. I know that
    many community members will still hold Oracle in a bad light - but surely Apache
    must have the enlightenment (and independence) to look towards the future. Having
    two products in Libre and OO is perhaps not a bad thing, and a re-alignment of
    the code base may be hard to achieve, but please can the aggressiveness and legal
    wrangling over licence wording be dropped? - This has to come from the very top
    of TDF and Apace. Okay, some people''s feelings and pride got hurt, but we should
    be mature enough to make peace. The founding objective should be to produce excellent
    software. '

  content: "I'm new to Open Office but very impressed and I want to transiton completely
    away from Microsoft tools.  I'd appreciate suggestions for a version of Linux
    that will work well with OOffice (probably most) and have the best chance of getting
    me going in this new environment without forcing me 'under the covers' of Linux.
    \ Also, I'm interested in voice-to-text and possibly working with Asterix for
    my phone.\r\n\r\nProbably the wrong place to start asking, but thanks in advance
    for your suggestions."

    will ) and have enjoyed its ease of use.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting development.
    I would never have known beforehand that the OpenOffice Project would become a
    project of the Apache Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nHere's to keeping OpenOffice
    alive and well, and hopefully some fantastic new ideas brought to the table!\r\n\r\n-

<p>We're pleased to announce that the ASF Board, at their October monthly meeting, approved a resolution promoting the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> Podling to an Apache Top Level Project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board also appointed a Project Management Committee (PMC) to oversee the project, with Andrea Pescetti as Chairman.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Further details on the graduation can be found in this <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces35">ASF Press Release</a>.&nbsp; Also available are translations into <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/it/stampa/comunicati/aoo-graduation.html">Italian</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/de/presse/pressemitteilung_20121018_Graduierung.html">German</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/fr/news/2012-10-graduation.html">French</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/ja/news/graduation.html">Japanese</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/es/noticias/graduacion.html">Spanish</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-tw/news/graduation.html">Traditional</a> and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-cn/news/graduation.html">Simplified</a> Chinese, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/da/graduation.html">Danish</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/sk/news/aoo_graduation.html">Slovak </a>and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/pt-br/news/aoo_gratuation.html">Brazilian Portuguese</a>.</p>
<p>The members of the Project Management Committee, along with the many<br />
Committers and Contributors now look forward to continued success in<br />
developing the award-winning Apache OpenOffice productivity<br />
applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What does this mean for users of OpenOffice?&nbsp; In the near future there will be some changes to the website and mailing lists, as we move out of the Incubator.&nbsp; We're hoping to avoid any disruptive changes during this transition.&nbsp; <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Graduation+Infrastructure+Changes">Details of changes</a> will be posted on our wiki.&nbsp; But aside from these small administrative and infrastructure changes, work on the next release of Apache OpenOffice continues.&nbsp; And we all look forward to meeting in Sinsheim, Germany, in a few weeks for <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu/">ApacheCon Europe</a>!</p></p>
