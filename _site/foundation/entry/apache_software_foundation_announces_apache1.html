<meta name="description" content="Open Source abstraction layer over Apache Hadoop&reg; YARN simplifies developing distributed Hadoop applications. Forest Hill, MD &ndash;27 July 2016&ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Twill&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. Apache Twill is an abstraction over Apache Hadoop&reg; YARN that reduces the complexity of developing distributed Hadoop applications, allowing developers to focus more on their application logic. &quot;The Twill community is excited to graduate from the Apache Incubator to a Top-Level Project,&quot; said Terence Yim, Vice President of Apache Twill and Software Engineer at Cask. &quot;We are proud of the innovation, creativity and simplicity Twill demonstrates. We are also very excited to bring a technology so versatile in Hadoop into the hands of every developer in the industry.&quot; Apache Twill provides rich built-in features for common distributed applications for development, deployment, and management, greatly easing Hadoop cluster operation and administration. &quot;Enterprises use big data technologies - and specifically Hadoop - to drive more value,&quot; said Patrick Hunt, member of the Apache Software Foundation and Senior Software Engineer at Cloudera. &quot;Apache Twill helps streamline and reduce complexity of developing distributed applications and its graduation to an Apache Top-Level Project means more people will be able to take advantage of Apache Hadoop YARN more easily.&quot; &quot;This is an exciting and major milestone for Apache Twill,&quot;&nbsp;said Keith Turner, member of the Apache Fluo (incubating) Project Management Committee, which used Twill in the development of Fluo, an Open Source project that makes it possible to update the results of a large-scale computation, index, or analytic as new data is discovered. &quot;Early in development, we knew we needed a standard way to launch Fluo across a cluster, and we found Twill. With Twill, we quickly and easily had Fluo running across many nodes on a cluster.&quot;&nbsp; Apache Twill is in production by several organizations across various industries, easing distributed Hadoop application development and deployment. Twill originated at Cask in early 2013. After 7 major releases, the project was submitted to the Apache Incubator in November of 2013. &quot;Apache Twill has come a long way through The Apache Software Foundation, and we&#39;re thrilled it has become an ASF Top-Level Project,&quot;&nbsp;said Nitin Motgi, CTO of Cask. &quot;Apache Twill has become a key component behind the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP), using YARN containers and Java threads as the processing abstraction. CDAP is an Open Source integration and application platform that makes it easy for developers and organizations to quickly build, deploy and manage data applications on Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.&quot; &quot;The Apache Twill community worked extremely well within the incubator environment, developing and collaborating openly to follow The Apache Way,&quot; said Henry Saputra, ASF Member and member of the Apache Twill Project Management Committee. &quot;There is a tremendous demand for effective APIs and virtualization for developing big data applications and Apache Twill fills that need perfectly. We&rsquo;re looking forward to continuing the journey with Apache Twill as a Top-Level Project.&quot; Catch Apache Twill in action at: JavaOne, 18-22 September 2016 in San Francisco Strata+Hadoop World, 27-29 September 2016 in New York City Availability and Oversight Apache Twill software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.

All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
