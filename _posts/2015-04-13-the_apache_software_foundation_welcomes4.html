<p><b><i>Sponsorship provides critical infrastructure and support services that keep the Foundation running on a day-to-day basis.</i></b> </p>
<div>
<p><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;13 April 2015&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Pivotal has renewed its sponsorship of the ASF with an upgrade to the Platinum level.</p>
</p></div>
<div>"The ASF continues to flourish thanks to essential support from Sponsors such as Pivotal," said ASF President Ross Gardler. "Their generosity helps us nurture diverse and independent Open Source communities, that, in turn, create reliable, trusted software. This is at the heart of the ASF, and we're proud to celebrate 15 years of community-led development."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Pivotal is first and foremost an open source company and we contribute to the global community in many ways," said Leo Spiegel, senior vice president of corporate development and strategy at Pivotal. "In addition to our support for the Spring developer community, our participation in the Cloud Foundry Foundation, and more recently joining as a member of the Open Data Platform, we are extremely excited to extend our commitment to the Apache Software Foundation with Platinum-level sponsorship this year. Our increased contribution to the Apache Software Foundation will help us better support the open source community while delivering increased value to our enterprise customers."</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a United States 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF relies on individual donors and corporate sponsors to help bolster existing projects, incubate new initiatives, and promote meritocratic, community-driven development "The Apache Way". In addition, ASF Sponsorship provides critical infrastructure and support services that keep the Foundation running on a day-to-day basis.</div>
<div>
<p>Pivotal has been an ASF Sponsor since the company was founded in April 2013. Pivotal team members are active contributors to numerous Apache projects, and serve on several Project Management Committees and mentor emerging projects in the Apache Incubator.</p>
<p>Pivotal joins Platinum level Sponsors Citrix, Cloudera, Facebook, Google, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, and Yahoo!; Gold Sponsors Comcast, HP, Hortonworks, and IBM; Silver Sponsors Budget Direct, Cerner, InMotion Hosting, iSIGMA, Produban, and WANdisco; and Bronze Sponsors Accor, Basis Technology, Bluehost, Cloudsoft Corporation, Samsung, Talend, and Twitter.
