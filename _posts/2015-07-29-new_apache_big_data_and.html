<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO - July 29, 2015 -</b> The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux and collaborative development, today announced the lineup of speakers and sessions for Apache: Big Data and ApacheCon: Core Europe, The Apache Software Foundation&rsquo;s (ASF) official conference series which will showcase dozens of key Apache projects across topics and tracks such as cloud computing, deployment, Internet of Things (IoT), libraries, microservices, web development, community, and more. The events will take place 1-2 October 2015 at the Corinthia Hotel in Budapest, Hungary.</p>
</p></div>
<div>Apache: Big Data will be held in Budapest, September 28 - 30, with content designed to gather together the Apache projects, people and technologies working on big data, ubiquitous computing and data engineering and science to educate, collaborate and connect in a vendor-neutral environment.</div></p>
