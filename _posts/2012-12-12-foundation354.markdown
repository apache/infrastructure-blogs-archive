<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>&quot;Open Source Community Leadership Drives Enterprise-Grade
Innovation&quot; showcases dozens of key Apache projects across Big Data, Cloud
Computing, Infrastructure, Messaging, Scientific Applications, and more.</i></b><i><o:p /></i></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Forest Hill, MD – 12 December
2012 –</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers,
stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives,
today announced the program and early registration incentives for ApacheCon
North America 2013, the 25th edition of the ASF's official conference,
trainings, and expo.<o:p /></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">Taking place 24 February-2 March 2013 at the Hilton Portland
&amp; Executive Tower in Portland, Oregon, ApacheCon is the ideal opportunity
for those developing Apache-based solutions, as well as those interested in committing
code to an Apache project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing
their Open Source products and community practices. ApacheCon offers an
excellent way to meet the individual contributors behind some of the industry's
most popular Apache projects through hands-on educational sessions and ample
networking opportunities.<o:p /></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">This year's theme is &quot;Open Source Community Leadership
Drives Enterprise-Grade Innovation&quot;, reflecting the enormous reach and
influence of the ASF. Apache products power half the Internet, petabytes of
data, teraflops of operations, billions of objects, and enhance the lives of
countless users and developers. First held in 1998 for developers and users of
the Apache Server to meet face-to-face, ApacheCon is the public showcase for
Apache innovations, from the ubiquitous flagship Apache HTTP Server to industry-defining solutions in Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Infrastructure, to dozens of emerging
projects in the Apache Incubator and Labs.<o:p /></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal">The event will kick off with two days of pre-conference
trainings, BarCamp, and Hackathon activities, followed by the main conference +
expo 26-28 February, and will close with post-conference sprints, workshops,
and team building events. <o:p /></p>
