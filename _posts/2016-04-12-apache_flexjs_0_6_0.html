  SDK 0.6.0 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.6.0.\r\n\r\nApache Flex is a highly
  productive, open source application framework for\r\nbuilding and maintaining expressive
  applications that deploy consistently\r\non all major browsers, desktops and devices
  (including smartphones,\r\ntablets and tv).\r\n\r\nApache FlexJS is a next-generation
  Flex SDK that enables developers to use\r\nMXML and ActionScript to not only create
  SWFs but also cross-compile the\r\nsame MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so
  applications can run natively\r\nin browsers.  The cross-compiled code can also
  be used in Apache Cordova\r\n(Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.\r\n\r\nApache
  Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript\r\ncross-compiler.  It

  content: "Dear Apache Flex team,\r\n\r\nCongratulations to you for releasing new
    versions of Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX. It is really great to see
    good process happening in the path for FlexJS and Falcon compiler. Being a devoted
    Flex developer we all are very emotional about \"Flex\". We are migrated to other
    JS platform for the survival and now looking forward to adapt and contribute in
    the development of Apache FlexJS products. We all should make sure that Flex should
    get back its old market position again with its new avatar. I am going to download
    try the product. \r\n\r\nThanks you very much for the updates\r\nThx,\r\nSachin"

<p>The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache<br />
FlexJS SDK 0.6.0 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.6.0.</p>
<p>Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for<br />
building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently<br />
on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones,<br />
tablets and tv).</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use<br />
MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the<br />
same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively<br />
in browsers.  The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova<br />
(Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.</p>
<p>Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript<br />
cross-compiler.  It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as<br />
Falcon.  Both are contained in the release package and are used by the<br />
FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS.</p>
<p>This is the fourth release of FlexJS and FalconJX.  It is &lsquo;beta'<br />
quality.  In this release, all JS used to implement framework<br />
functionality is actually written in AS and cross-compiled, which helps<br />
show that there is developer productivity improvements using higher-level<br />
languages.  In addition, the there is a new Storage.swc for working with<br />
the persistent storage and a Reflection.swc for basic reflection<br />
functionality.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a new tool called asnodec (in js/bin).  It causes<br />
the compiler to output an index.js that can be run with Node.js.</p>
<p>Also, Apache FlexJS 0.6.0 is now available as a npm package. On a system<br />
With npm installed, users can easily install FlexJS with the command:</p>
<pre>  npm install flexjs -g </pre>
<p>Or you can use the Installer as described below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the<br />
features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we<br />
grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest<br />
productivity developing applications that can run in the most places.<br />
These releases may not handle production needs.  Expect lots of bugs and<br />
missing features.  Please file bugs at:</p>
<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX/</a></p>
<p>For questions about how to use FlexJS and FalconJX, send email to<br />
users@flex.apache.org.  Please try to prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or<br />
[FalconJX] so it is clear the questions refer to this release and not the<br />
Flex SDK and MXMLC compiler.</p>
<p>For questions and feedback on the development of the source code in these<br />
release, send email to dev@flex.apache.org.  Again, please prefix the<br />
subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX].</p>
<p>Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX are available in source and binary<br />
form from the following download page:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html">http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html</a></p>
<p>When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the<br />
downloads using signatures or MD5 hashes.</p>
<p>A simple way to try these releases is to use the<br />
InstallApacheFlex 3.1 or 3.2 application which is available at the<br />
following url:<br />
<a href="http://flex.apache.org/installer.html">http://flex.apache.org/installer.html</a></p>
<p>Choose Apache FlexJS 0.6.0 and it will create an Adobe Flash<br />
Builder-compatible SDK that uses the Falcon and FalconJX compilers to<br />
generate SWFs and HTML/JS/CSS output.  You can also use FDT as your IDE<br />
for developing FlexJS applications.  Some folks have been successful<br />
using IntelliJ, FlashDevelop as well.  Moonshine is also working on<br />
FlexJS support.</p>
