<meta name="description" content="Highly-scalable, Open Source &quot;NoSQL&quot; Distributed Database Handles Massive Workloads for Cisco, Constant Contact, DataStax, Digg, IBM, Netflix, Rackspace, Twitter, Walmart Labs, and more. Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 18 October 2011 &ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache Cassandra&trade; v1.0. The highly-scalable, distributed&nbsp;&quot;NoSQL&quot;&nbsp;database plays a key role in Cloud computing by quickly handling massive workloads in real time with minimal disruption to services or systems. &quot;Dealing with very large amounts of data in realtime is a must for most businesses today,&quot; said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra. &quot;Cassandra accommodates high query volumes, provides enterprise-grade reliability, and scales easily to meet future growth requirements &ndash; while using fewer resources than traditional solutions.&quot; Apache Cassandra is successfully used by large scale organizations such as Cisco, Cloudkick, Digg, Rackspace, Reddit, Twitter, and Walmart Labs to affordably process massive data sets in real-time across large server clusters. The largest Cassandra production cluster to date exceeds 300 terabytes of data over 400 machines. &quot;As the most-widely deployed mobile rich media advertising platform, Medialets uses Apache Cassandra&trade; for handling time series based logging from our production operations infrastructure,&quot; said Joe Stein, Chief Architect of Medialets. &quot;We store contiguous counts for data points for each second, minute, hour, day, month so we can review trends over time as well as the current real time set of information for tens of thousands of data points. Cassandra makes it possible for us to manage this intensive data set and the release of 1.0 makes it that much easier.&quot; Deployed across an array of applications, from barcode scanning and geospatial databases to storing user account information and activity logs, Apache Cassandra is easily scalable, efficient, and &nbsp;performant, typically handling over 5,000 requests per second per core. Innovative uses of Apache Cassandra include:&lt;/p&gt; AppScale &ndash; back-end for Google App Engine applications Clearspring &ndash; tracking URL sharing and serving over 200 million daily view requests Cloudtalk &ndash; &nbsp;creating messaging applications Constant Contact &ndash; &nbsp;powering social media marketing applications Formspring &ndash; counting/storing social graph data for 26 million accounts with 10 million daily responses Mahalo.com &ndash; recording user Q &amp; A activity logs and topics&nbsp; Netflix &ndash; streaming services back-end database Openwave &ndash; distributed storage mechanism for next generation messaging platform OpenX &ndash; storing and replicating advertisements and targeting data for ad delivery over 130 nodes Plaxo &ndash; analyzing 3 billion contacts against public data sources and identifying 600 million unique contacts RockYou &ndash; recording every single click in real time for 50 million online gaming users Urban Airship &ndash; mobile service hosting for over 160 million application installs across 80 million unique devices&nbsp; Yakaz &ndash; storing millions of images and social data Matthew Conway, CTO of Backupify said, &quot;Apache Cassandra&trade; makes it possible for us to build a business around really high write loads in a scalable fashion without having to build and operate our own sharding layer. The release of Cassandra 1.0 is an exciting milestone for the project and we look forward to exploring the new features and performance enhancements.&quot; &quot;We utilize Apache Cassandra&trade; to deliver DataStax Enterprise, a distributed data platform that makes it easy for customers to build, deploy, and operate elastically scalable on-premise and cloud-optimized applications,&quot; explained Billy Bosworth, CEO of DataStax. &quot;We chose Cassandra to power this platform because of it&#39;s real-time scalability, operational simplicity, and above all, its active community of dedicated developers.
