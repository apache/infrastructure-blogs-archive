  content: Fritz may have looked like a troll, but the old fellow evidently had the
    sexual appetite of a satyr. All too often I could hear the sounds of Greg and
    Fritz fucking, but these encounters seemed brief and it seemed to me that the
    majority of the groans of pleasure I heard came from Fritz. Greg could be heard
    grunting against the force of Fritz's thrusts but I rarely heard him make the
    sounds issued in the throes of an intense orgasm. Still, the sounds gave me a
    voyeuristic thrill and whenever I heard them going at it I became terribly horny
    https://www.bigbootytube.xxx . At first, I'd pull at my rod, imagining it was
    me with some girl from school, or the girl I was dating, but eventually I began
    to imagine that it was me in there with Greg. I would come unusually quickly over
    fantasies of Greg.

  content: "Hi,\r\n I'm trying to update JAMES from 2.3.2 to the security patch 2.3.2.1
    which has been downloaded as suggested above. \r\n When I try to start JAMES up
    there is an error in the log file indicating the \"<users-store>\" failed to pass
    through the starting stage. The config.xml file being used is the same as was
    being used on 2.3.2. The error indicates there is a syntax error with the \"destination
    >>URL\".\r\n I can see this attribute in the XML config file but it looks exactly
    the same as the syntax shown on these web pages and the same as the syntax of
    the standard config.xml file generated when the james/app is unpacked.\r\n Has
    anyone had problems in this area ?  \r\n"
