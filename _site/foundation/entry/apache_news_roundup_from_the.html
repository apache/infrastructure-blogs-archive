<meta name="description" content="The following newsworthy events took place during the course of ApacheCon North America 1-5 November: &lt;/p&gt; 1) Foundation Updates Membership count: 330 (31 new Members; 52 emeritus) Committer count: +2,500 (approximately 200 additional Committers over the past year) The ASF is governed by the community it most directly serves -- the people collaborating within its projects. Apache Committers are developers who contribute (individuals who &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; code, patches, or documentation) directly to the Apache code repository. Apache Members are Committers who have demonstrated merit in the Foundation&rsquo;s growth, evolution, and progress, and have been nominated for and elected to be awarded ASF Membership by existing Members. ASF Members have the right to vote on community-related decisions; and and the ability propose an active user for Committership.&nbsp; Sponsors: the ASF welcomed new Sponsors AMD and IBM at the Gold level, and Lucid Imagination at the Bronze level. Java Community Process: the ASF&#39;s seat on the JCP Executive Committee was ratified on 2 November 2010. &lt;/p&gt; 2) Apache Projects Apache Top-level Projects: 82 total; new Apache Projects added are Avro, Axis, Cassandra, Click, HBase, Hive, Karaf, Mahout, Nutch, Pivot, Shindig, Subversion, Tika, Traffic Server, UIMA. Project updates include Apache Hive v0.6.0; Apache James Server 3.0-M1; Apache Jackrabbit v2.0.3 and v2.1.2; Apache Tomcat Connectors v1.2.31; and Apache Mahout v0.4. Apache Incubator: 41 projects are currently under development. New to the Apache Incubator are: Alois, Clerezza, Deltacloud, Etch, Isis, libcloud, Lucene Connector Framework, Lucy, Nuvem, OODT, Whirr, and Zeta Components.&nbsp; Apache Labs: 32 initiatives being sandboxed. Apache Labs projects are created to quickly explore technical viability without the necessity of community building. 3) Events BarCampApache: the ASF will be hosting its first event in Australia at the University of Sydney on 11 December 2010. ApacheCon: the next North American conference will be in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 7-11 November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; For more information, contact Sally Khudairi, VP Marketing &amp; Publicity at press@apache.org. &lt;/p&gt; # # #&nbsp;" />
