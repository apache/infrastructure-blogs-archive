There are alot of companies who contribute to BigTop. &nbsp;Pivotal, Cloudera, Red Hat, WanDisco, Amazon and so on... if I left yours out feel free to leave a comment below and I&#39;ll update this post. &nbsp;And today, we&nbsp;are proud&nbsp;&nbsp;to announce that Red Hat is hosting the next bigtop hackathon, immediately following Hadoop Summit 2014, in San Jose. &nbsp;Hadoop is about alot more than just soucre code - its about packaging, deployment, configuration, and so on. &nbsp;And&nbsp;BigTop has embraced the difficult task of tying all this together. Apache BigTop makes Hadoop deployment transparent All source code is complex, regardless of the language. &nbsp;But whats even more complex is the deployment of code on a distributed system. &nbsp;While vendors have come a long way making it easy to DEPLOY hadoop with black box administrative or cloud tools, nobody has really opened up hadoop by building a culture around the deployment of it. Enter Apache BigTop.&nbsp; BigTop contains all the stuff thats not in the hadoop docs. &nbsp;For example: &lt;/p&gt; Puppet modules&nbsp;for installation and configuration of hadoop without using a tarball. Vagrant recipes for deployment-from-zero. Smoke tests for fine grained testing. The intersection of Java and RPM . bigpetstore app for demonstrating to the business community how to actually use hadoop, gradle, pig, and google&#39;s javascript visualization widgets tools to build, test, and deploy a reference &quot;hadoop app&quot;. BigTop is working to embrace HCFS The community has put alot of work into testing different hadoop stacks on different file systems (https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HCFS/Progress), and the bigtop community has embraced this effort - to their own higher cost of having to support a generic filesystem deployment, and also, at the cost of alot of JIRA reviewing. &nbsp;For example, with the recent BIGTOP-952 and BIGTOP-1200 JIRAs, we&#39;re now packaging HDFS independent artifacts into BigTop. &nbsp;That paves the way for more competition, more choice, and more hadoop hacking - which ultimately translates to a better end-user experiences, around hadoop. BigTop builds OS+Admin freindly packages for emerging ecosystem projects, fast ! If you compare apache bigtop with other hadoop vendor distributions, you&#39;ll find that it is the bleeding edge. &nbsp;For example, you can watch this recent video demonstration of spinning up Storm on BigTop, from ApacheCon 2014:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZzJxsMJahc, to see just how easy it is to deploy spark out of the box using BigTop&#39;s deployment recipes. &nbsp;As new projects come forward in the upstream, the first place to put them is into apache BigTop. &nbsp;This means that if you want to try out&nbsp;a new animal in hadoop&#39;s stack, you can easily do so with the bigtop stack. &nbsp;And again : the infrastructure around vagrant makes it easy to build maintainable VM workflows around hadoop app and distribution development tasks, which easily be modified to include/exlude whichever bleeding edge packages.&nbsp; &nbsp;Think of bigtop&#39;s approach to packaging and deployment as a lower-level version of apache ambari. Sounds Interesting? come to the hackathon in Mountain View after Hadoop Summit &nbsp;!&nbsp; So this is all prelude to the BigTop hackathon that we are hosting at &nbsp;Red Hat. &nbsp;The focus will be on hacking - not presentations. &nbsp;But that doesn&#39;t mean you have to be an expert to get involved. &nbsp;Coming to this hackathon will give you a chance to pair program with the BigTop commiters, and try your hand at a working directly on a JIRA. &nbsp;I think most would agree that hacking around on&nbsp;apache bigtop is an excellent introduction to that hadoop ecosystem. &nbsp; The NEXT HACKATHON will be from June 6th - JUNE 9th at the Red Hat Offices in Mountain View California. &nbsp;For more details, ping us on the BigTop mailing list and check the meetup URL :&nbsp;http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Bigtop-Meetup/events/184893732/&nbsp;.

<p>There are alot of companies who contribute to BigTop. &nbsp;Pivotal, Cloudera, Red Hat, WanDisco, Amazon and so on... if I left yours out feel free to leave a comment below and I'll update this post. &nbsp;And today, <b>we&nbsp;are proud&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;to announce that <b>Red Hat</b> is hosting the next bigtop hackathon, immediately following Hadoop Summit 2014, in San Jose. &nbsp;Hadoop is about alot more than just soucre code - its about packaging, deployment, configuration, and so on. &nbsp;And&nbsp;<b>BigTop </b>has embraced the difficult task of tying all this together.</p>
