<meta name="description" content="First Apache Unconference in Australia to be held on 11th December 2010Forest Hill, MD - 6 December 2010 &ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and the University of Sydney today announced BarCampApache Sydney, the ASF&#39;s first event in the Southern Hemisphere. Taking place at the University of Sydney&#39;s Darlington Centre on 11th December, BarCampApache is an attendee-driven event, focusing on &quot;The Apache Way&quot; of developing Open Source software. The event is open to the public free of charge. &quot;We are pleased to partner with the University of Sydney, whose commitment to sharing knowledge, high value collaboration, and next-generation innovation closely aligns with The Apache Software Foundation,&quot; said ASF President Jim Jagielski. &quot;Events such as BarCampApache helps promote awareness of the tremendous impact of Open Source solutions, and an opportunity for members of the technology community to meet, network, and learn in an open environment.&quot; The free to attend, one-day event will be facilitated by ASF Members Nick Burch, Aristedes Maniatis, Gavin McDonald, Noirin Plunkett, and Brett Porter. The BarCampApache program will be proposed and decided by the participants themselves. Dozens of Open Source professionals, academics, and enthusiasts will address an array of topics focusing on Apache products, including open development techniques and best practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, as well as engaging with and incubating new initiatives within the ASF. The ad-hoc nature of BarCamp sessions allows discussions to flow freely and deepen with smaller groups throughout the day. BarCampApache Sydney is hosted by the Information and Communications Technology centre at the University of Sydney, with additional support provided by sponsors Alfresco, Atlassian, IBM, and MaestroDev.
