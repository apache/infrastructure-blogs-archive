    because I thought it was evident given the context. It also wasn''t my intention

  content: Then simply do not release it as 9.0. But as a RC, Alpha, Beta, whatever.
    We are during a period that most of open-source IDEs (eclipse, netbeans) have
    fallen behind commercial competition (that is Jetbrains). Do yourselves a favor
    and think about business-wise. Hold up the release of the product until it is
    ready and in a good state. Or else the last few of us that insist on using open-source
    products will also jump ship, just my 2 cents ...

  content: You could consider helping make NetBeans better by experimenting with the
    newest release. NetBeans is no longer simply here for you to use, in one way or
    another please consider what you can do to make it even better than it is. You
    are needed, not simply as someone who waits to use, but as an actual participant
    in the process.

  content: "First of all, my kudos to all the volunteers who have accepted the work
    and responsibility of maintaining a beast that a big corporation is not willing
    to. You really have my appreciation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, my two cents and a question.
    \r\n\r\nI briefly tried 9.0 when it was out. I successfully got rid of Java stuff
    (whether it was a good idea is something I'm not qualified to assert) and installed
    PHP plugins (most of them anyway). Subversion does not work at all. Also, it uses
    \"%APPDATA%\\NetBeans\\dev\" as profile location and broke my 201804200002 set-up
    so I'm glad I had backup copies.\r\n\r\nAm I right if I assume that actual bugfixing
    is not really feasible until second donation completes?"

    as well, while these developers can install those features via plugins. Join in

  content: "First, Kudo's to the Apache crew and thanks for all of your effort.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    please ignore what appears to be Trolling from JetBrains Fanboys, as unlike some,
    us long term users of Netbeans enjoy the Open Source alternatives that are available.\r\n\r\nNow,
    while Eclipse, Netbeans or even Jetbrains and \"others\" may have interesting
    features, one size does not fit all and never has.\r\n\r\nAs for the idea that
    any Open source product \"lacks features\" because it isn't a copy of a \"Commercial
    Product\", that just beggars belief.\r\n\r\nMany of us are quite happy with what
    we have and don't really need features we don't use and/or don't find useful.\r\nFor
    those that do, it's called modular design, there's probably a plugin for that.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    many of us appreciate what the Apache Foundation has done and continues to do.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Netbeans, the last stable version, 8.2 is still available from Netbeans.org
    and still works as intended.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Apache won't improve
    things, given that I was one of the those who appreciated Apache 1.3 when first
    released. \r\nJust look where we are today. \r\n\r\nAll thanks to the Apache Foundation.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I can't help but notice that not only is the sky not falling but that given the
    previous Track record of the Apache Foundation, eventually, Netbeans will hopefully
    become the third force in cross platform Developer tools.\r\n\r\nLove your work
    folks, keep it up."

<p>So, you start up <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/entry/tentative-schedule-for-apache-netbeans">Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0</a> and... you find that when you go to the New Project wizard, or when you try to open your projects, that there's no support for your JavaScript, PHP, Groovy, enterprise Java (i.e., Java EE or, as it is known now, Jakarta EE), and C/C++ projects.</p>
<p>What's the reason for that and what can be done?</p>
<p>Well, Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 is specifically focused on Java SE only. Why? Because NetBeans is extremely large (it will be by far the largest project in Apache, once everything has been donated), which is because it has existed for over 20 years and provides support for a very wide range of technologies. Since so many files all needed to be audited before they could be donated to Apache, the decision was made to donate NetBeans in pieces, i.e., not everything at the same time because that would have taken much too long.</p>
<p>And since NetBeans is modular, doing an incremental donation was not difficult to architect. The first donation focused specifically on the underlying core, i.e., the NetBeans Platform (e.g., the module system, window system, menubar, etc etc) and, to enable the result of the first donation to be usable for general users and not just NetBeans Platform developers, the various Java SE features were included too, e.g., Java project templates, Java editor, and new Java features such as support for Jigsaw, JLink, and JShell.</p>
<p>The above is what Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 consists of. In the meantime, the second donation has been completed, i.e., Oracle has audited and donated all the modules for features providing support for JavaScript, PHP, Groovy, and enterprise Java (i.e., Java EE or, as it is known now, Jakarta EE). These features are on a separate branch in the Apache NetBeans Git repo. They will be integrated, i.e., relicensed to Apache, after Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 is released. After that, the next set of modules that is being audited prior to donation are related to C/C++.</p>
<p>So, does that mean that all the features that are not integrated into Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 cannot be used? No, it does not. Go to Tools | Plugins in Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 and, in the Settings tab, register the NetBeans IDE 8.2 update center:</p>
<p>http://updates.netbeans.org/netbeans/updates/8.2/uc/final/distribution/catalog.xml.gz</p>
<p>Then go to the Available Plugins tab and you'll see all the plugins for NetBeans IDE 8.2., and search for the word "Kit", which will give you bundles of modules, for higher-level features such as C/C++, JavaScript, Groovy, PHP, and enterprise Java (i.e., Java EE or, as it is known now, Jakarta EE).</p>
<p>Though note that none of these features have been tested with Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0, they should work, in most cases. If not, don't panic. Just sign up to the Apache NetBeans mailing lists, as explained at <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org">netbeans.apache.org</a>, and start a new thread where you'll highlight some problem you've encountered, after which someone will help you or you'll be advised to create a new issue in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NETBEANS">Apache NetBeans Issuezilla</a>.</p>
<p>Where is all this documented, how can anyone know what will be donated in which order, etc? Easy, go here, to the end of this page:</p>
