<p>I'm delighted to announce that Oscar Bou has been voted in as a committer on <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>, and also to as a member of the Isis PMC. The first gives Oscar the right to commit changes directly to Isis' codebase, the second gives him the right to be involved in future votes.

</p>
  <p>Oscar has ticked the boxes in terms of being a committer: using the mailing lists appropriately, raising JIRA tickets, provided patches to address specific issues, providing help to others in the community. But he's gone beyond that in raising a number of insightful - sometimes challenging - questions regarding Isis' design/responsibilities as a framework, and shown that he's keen to address these issues and thus improve Isis as a product.

</p>
  <p>I'm looking forward to working with Oscar in the future; another great addition to Isis' committers.

  <p>As a bit of tidying up, we have also voted for Jeroen van der Wal, and Maurizio Taverna, to be members of the Isis PMC.</p>
