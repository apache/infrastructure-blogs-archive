“home-away-from-home” for code associated with Apache projects</b></i></p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>Forest Hill, MD – 14 December 2010
–</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) today announced
<a href="http://apache-extras.org">apache-extras.org</a>, the Google-hosted site for code associated with
Apache projects that are not part of the Foundation's more than
eighty Top-level Projects and dozens of initiatives in the Apache
Incubator and Labs.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">&quot;The Apache Software Foundation
has a long history of software innovation through collaboration; the
larger the pool of potential contributors the more innovation we
see,&quot; said Ross Gardler, ASF Vice President of Community
Development. &quot;Apache Extras provides a home for Apache related
software which is not formally a part of the ASF itself. Having these
projects on a single hosting platform will help to further accelerate
innovation involving Apache software.&quot;</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Among the ASF's strengths are its
well-established requirements relating to intellectual property
management, license use, and community management. Apache-extras.org
provides a home for projects that are unable to, or do not wish to,
conform to those rules yet still want to signal their relationship to
official Apache projects.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As projects on the new Google-hosted
service will not be managed by The Apache Software Foundation,
participants are allowed to use whatever license and project
management process they desire. <a href="http://www.apache-extras.org">Apache-extras.org</a> will provide a
level of visibility for these projects that is unavailable on other
code-hosting forges.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Existing Google Code projects related
to Apache products can be easily migrated to the new
apache-extras.org site, whilst those involved with new Apache-related
projects can start quickly by filling out a simple form. The ASF
Community Development team will work directly with Apache Extras to
ensure innovation around Apache projects is accelerated.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Technical queries regarding the ASF's
relationship with apache-extras.org can be directed to the ASF
Community Development team at dev@community.apache.org. For

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><b>About The Apache Software Foundation
(ASF)</b></p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Established in 1999, the all-volunteer
Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source
projects, including Apache HTTP Server — the world's most popular
Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as
&quot;The Apache Way,&quot; more than 300 individual Members and
2,500 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available
enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide:
thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache
License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing
lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's
official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is funded by
individual donations and corporate sponsors including AMD, Basis
Technology, Facebook, Google, IBM, HP, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft,
SpringSource/VMware, and Yahoo!. For more information, visit
