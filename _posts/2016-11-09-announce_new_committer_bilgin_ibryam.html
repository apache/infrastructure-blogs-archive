<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">I'm delighted to announce that Bilgin Ibryam has been voted in as a committer on Apache Isis, and also as a member of the Isis PMC. &nbsp;The first gives Bilgin the right to commit changes directly to the Apache Isis codebase, the second gives him the right to be involved in future votes.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Bilgin is already a committer on both the Apache Camel [1,2,3] project and also for Apache Ofbiz [4, 5, 6]. &nbsp;He also recently wrote "Camel Design Patterns" book, via leanpub [7]. &nbsp;He works in London for RedHat [7]. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Bilgin has been aware of Apache Isis for a long while; in fact it was he who introduced the predecessor - naked objects framework - to Jeroen, from whence the Estatio project (a major driver for the development of Apache Isis) was spawned.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">More recently Bilgin has started contributing to the mailing list and started providing a number of pull requests [9]. &nbsp;He is also using Apache Isis for some internal projects within RedHat, which may help spread knowledge of the framework to a wider open-source community.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">I'm looking forward to working with Bilgin in the future; another great addition to Isis' committers. &nbsp;So please join me in welcoming him to our happy band!</div>
