<div><b><i>Highest performing &quot;NoSQL&quot; distributed Big Data database now faster, with improved analytics and ease-of-use.</i></b></div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div><b>Forest Hill, MD –11 September 2014–</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 200 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced at the Cassandra Summit the availability of Apache™ Cassandra™ v2.1, the highly-performant Big Data distributed database.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div> 
    <div>&quot;Every release reinforces why Cassandra is the database of choice for growing enterprises,&quot; said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra and CTO of DataStax. &quot;With 2.1 delivering over 50% better performance over 2.0's already-strong numbers, Cassandra 2.1 lets our users continuously improve their engagement with their customers at the highest speeds to date.&quot;</div> 
    <div><br /></div> 
    <div>Apache Cassandra is an Open Source, &quot;NoSQL&quot; distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers quickly and reliably, whether running in the Cloud or in a hybrid data store. Apache Cassandra has consistently led the NoSQL market in performance: its fully-distributed architecture provides unparalleled fault tolerance to ensure applications will not go offline, and its linear scalability allows them to reach massive sizes while successfully handling thousands of requests per second with no single point of failure. In addition, v2.1 is the first Cassandra release suitable for production use on Windows.</div> 
  </div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>Apache Cassandra powers hundreds of applications across dozens of industries that demand high performance at scale, and is in use at Adobe, Comcast, eBay, Eventbrite, GE, GoDaddy, HP, IBM, Intuit, Netflix, Pearson, Safeway, Sky, Sony, Spotify, Travelocity, The Weather Channel, and Zoosk, among others.</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Cassandra 2.0 introduced critical features and functions that that let us build out a real-time analytics engine,&quot; said Brian O'Neill, CTO at Health Market Science. &quot;The 2.1 release tightens the nuts and bolts and drops nitro into that engine to make those analytics blazing fast.&quot;</div> 
  <div><br /></div> 
  <div>&quot;Cassandra 2.1 represents an important milestone,&quot; said Duyhai Doan, Cassandra Expert at Orange. &quot;For us developers, the biggest game changer in 2.1 is the introduction of CQL3 tuple and user defined type (UDT) as both pave the way for new data model patterns and usage. In addition, the ease of use core value for Cassandra is fulfilled in this release.&quot;</div>
