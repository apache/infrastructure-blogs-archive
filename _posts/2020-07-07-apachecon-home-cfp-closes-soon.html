<p>The call for presentations (CFP) for ApacheCon @Home closes this weekend. Please don't leave it to the last minute. We're on a very compressed schedule for this event, and will not be extending the CFP past closing time.</p>
<p>Details about the event, and the CFP itself, may be found on the conference website at <a href="https://apachecon.com/acah2020" target="_blank">https://apachecon.com/acah2020</a></p>
