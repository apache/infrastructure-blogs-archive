<meta name="description" content="Who: The Apache Software Foundation (ASF): all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives. What: In development for nearly 10 years, and an ASF Top-Level Project since 2003, Apache Maven is the build system of choice for millions of developers and thousands of organizations world-wide. Why: Maven 3 represents the culmination of nearly two years of work re-architecting the internals of the system based on experience gained over the last five years with Maven 2.x. Maven 3 is faster, more reliable, and more extensible, with users already reporting 10-40% improvements in build time over Maven 2. &quot;A key priority for our users was backward compatibility,&quot; said Brian Fox, Vice President of Apache Maven. &quot;We&#39;ve invested a significant amount of time and effort to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining backward compatibility with Maven 2 builds and plugins.&quot; Highlights of the release include: Parallel build capability Conversion of IoC system from Plexus to Guice, including a Plexus compatibility layer Rewritten dependency resolution logic, designed to be extensible and embedded in other applications Improved POM validation during the build to warn users of potential problems Improved error handling and messages Decoupled reporting engine from the core New inheritance and interpolation code designed to be extensible and allow composition of POMs in future releases More robust handling of local repository data True plugin classpath isolation Massively improved regression test suite for Maven core and plugins Further details are available at http://maven.apache.org/docs/3.0/release-notes.html&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/a&gt; When: Apache Maven 3 was released on 8 October 2010 In addition, Apache Maven training will be held on 1 November at ApacheCon in Atlanta, Georgia. Where: Apache Maven 3 is released under the Apache License v2.0, and available for download at http://maven.apache.org/ For details on Maven training visit http://apachecon.com" />
