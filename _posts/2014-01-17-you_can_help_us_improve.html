  content: "I've used MS Word for years but one day, while trying to clean up my Disk,
    made a mistake and unwittingly deleted it. That's how I came to download OO in
    the first place. I generally like Open Office. I've used it for several months
    previously and have had very little in way of problems with it. It does seem to
    take a long time in opening, but this may not be due to program itself. I'd like
    to see a more fully equipped tool bar and one which had a better description of
    what's available\r\nM.C."

  content: "I was participating in a BBST class.  I was listing risks for Insert/Table.
    I was completing some exploritory testing to find boundaries in the table columns.
    \ I held down the up arrow on the column field and the climb stopped at 1,134
    columns.  When I clicked 'ok' the image on the page is one black box.  I did not
    recieve an error message in regards to the columns being too numerous for the
    page spacing.  My expected result was very small columns as I had put a 99 in
    the field and my return was 99 columns.  Possibly and error message should fire
    when the number of columns exceeds the page width.  \r\n  "

<h3>A Call for QA Volunteers <br /></h3>
<p>This is a call for volunteers for our QA team.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) project has an ambitious plan for our next major release.&nbsp; But for this plan to be successful we need to grow our Quality Assurance (QA) team to keep up with the output from our programmers.&nbsp; The more QA volunteers we have, the more bugs we can find and get fixed for Apache OpenOffice.&nbsp; This work has a direct impact on OpenOffice product quality.&nbsp; It is also fun!</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Why volunteer?<br /></h3>
<p>Why would you want to help with OpenOffice QA?&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
<li>We're a fun, international group of testers, of a range of<br />
skills and experience, dedicated to free software and making OpenOffice a<br />
 high quality choice for users.</li>
<li>This is a good way to learn about QA and get some practical<br />
experience.&nbsp; This is useful, for example, if you are thinking about<br />
Software Quality Engineering (SQE) as a possible career choice.</li>
<li>Helping as a tester is a good way to "give back" to the open<br />
source community in a way that makes a direct difference in the product,<br />
 but doesn't require programming skills.</li>
<li>It is a good way to raise the visibility of bugs in areas that matter to you.&nbsp; For example, maybe you personally are<br />
concerned about bugs that cause problems on the Mac, or bugs that impact<br />
 color blind users, or bugs related to bidirectional text.&nbsp;<br />
Participating on the QA team is a good way to ensure that areas of<br />
personal interest work right.</li>
<li>We have tasks for volunteers with a range of skills.&nbsp; From<br />
novices who can help with manual testing and fix verifications, to<br />
experts who can help with our test automation framework, we have a full<br />
range of QA activities.</li>
<li>As an extremely popular open source product, with many millions<br />
of users, there are opportunities here to do some new and exciting<br />
things on the QA front.&nbsp; We're a laboratory for new ideas and approach to QA. </li>
</ol>
<h3>&nbsp;What does QA do?<br /></h3>
<p>QA activities within the Apache OpenOffice project include: </p>
<ul>
<li> Reviewing incoming bug reports from users to see if the reported issues can be reproduced</li>
<li>Verifying bugs that the developers say they have fixed, to confirm that they actually have been fixed</li>
<li>Testing new builds of OpenOffice against a test plan</li>
<li>Defining new test cases</li>
<li>Running automated regression tests</li>
<li>Specialized tests in areas such as performance, accessibility, localization, security, etc.</li>
<li>Analyzing defect reports to see how we are doing, in terms of quality level, defect find and fix rates, etc.</li>
<li>Reporting summary defect data and recommending whether a given build of OpenOffice is ready to release.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are we looking for? <br /></h3>
<p>The skills we need on the QA team include:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with OpenOffice as a user.</li>
<li>Attention to detail.&nbsp; In QA we find the bugs that the developers missed.&nbsp; And our developers are pretty good.</li>
<li>Access to a Windows, Mac or Linux machine for testing</li>
<li>Interest, enthusiasm and teamwork.</li>
<li>Also, specialized skills are always welcome, such as expertise in assistive technology tools, bidirectional scripts, East Asian text layout, power users of OpenOffice Base, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>
<p>You can start now, in three easy steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe to our public QA mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:qa-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">qa-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a> and responding to the confirmation email you will then receive.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself on the list by sending&nbsp; an email to the QA mailing list:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:qa@openoffice.apache.org">qa@openoffice.apache.org</a></li>
<li>Review our self-paced <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/index.html">orientation modules</a> to help you get started.&nbsp; If you are already familiar with open source<br />
development at Apache, then you can quickly skim over the Level 1 and Level 2 modules and concentrate on the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/intro-qa.html">Introduction to QA</a> module.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, you are new to Apache, and want a more methodical approach to getting started, then you can start at Level 1 modules first.</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon!</p>
