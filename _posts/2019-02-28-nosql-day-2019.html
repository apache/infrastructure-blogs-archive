<p>On May 21st in Washington, DC, there will be a one-day community event for Apache Accumulo,<br />
HBase, and Phoenix called <a href="https://dataworkssummit.com/nosql-day-2019/">NoSQL Day</a>. We hope that these three Apache communities can come together to share<br />
stories from the field and learn from one another. This event is being offered by the<br />
DataWorks Summit organization, prior to their DataWorks Summit event May 20th through 23rd.</p>
<p>At this time, we are looking for speakers, attendees, and sponsors for the event. For<br />
speakers, we hope to see a wide breadth of subjects and focus, anything from performance,<br />
scaling, real-life applications, dev-ops, or best-practices. All speakers are welcome!<br />
Abstracts can be submitted <a href="https://dataworkssummit.com/abstracts/">here</a>.</p>
<p>For attendees, we want to get the best and brightest from each of the respective communities<br />
because the organizers believe we have much to learn from from each other. We&rsquo;ve tried to<br />
keep costs down to make this approachable for all.</p>
<p>Finally, sponsors are the major enabler to provide events like these at low-costs<br />
to attendees. If you are interested in a corporate sponsorship, please feel free to contact<br />
<a href="mailto:elserj@apache.org">Josh Elser</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For general questions, please feel free to mail <a href="mailto:elserj@apache.org">Josh Elser</a> or the <a href="mailto:user@phoenix.apache.org">Phoenix user mailing list</a>.</p>
