<div><b><i>Open Source petabyte-scale Big Data Distributed Analytics Engine in use at eBay, Exponential, JD.com, Meituan, MiningLAMP, and NetEase, among others.</i></b></div>
<div><b><br /></b></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;8 December 2015&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: #f9f7ed;">&trade;</span>&nbsp;Kylin<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: #f9f7ed;">&trade;</span>&nbsp;has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Kylin is an Open Source Distributed Analytics Engine designed to provide a SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP) on Apache Hadoop<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: #f9f7ed;">&trade;</span>, supporting extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin's incubation journey has demonstrated the value of Open Source governance at ASF and the power of building an open-source community and ecosystem around the project," said Luke Han, Vice President of Apache Kylin. "Our community is engaging the world's biggest local developer community in alignment with the Apache Way."</div>
<div></div>
<div>A leading OLAP-on-Hadoop solution, Apache Kylin fills the gap between Big Data exploration and human use, enabling interactive analysis on massive datasets with sub-second latency for analysts, end users, developers, and data enthusiasts. With these capabilities, Apache Kylin brings back business intelligence (BI) to Apache Hadoop to unleash the value of Big Data. Kylin originated at eBay, and was submitted to the Apache Incubator in November 2014.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin brings Big Data to the enterprise and enables petabyte scale analytics on all the existing enterprise BI tools," said Debashis Saha, Vice President of Commerce Platform and Infrastructure at eBay. "We are extremely happy to do this in a community-driven manner and we look forward to continued innovation and collaboration of community members to advance Big Data OLAP."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin provides a fantastic solution which enabled us to do 'real' interactive analysis on large-scale data without significant query latency anymore," said Yinan Wu, Lead of Data Platform at NetEase (NASDAQ: NTES). "Many thanks to the Apache Kylin team. Apache Kylin will definitely benefit more users who are interested in OLAP for Big Data."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"As one of the mentors for Apache Kylin it was a pleasure to work with the team," said Henry Saputra, ASF Member and Apache Incubator Project Management Committee member. "The team learned the Apache Way very quickly and have been developing in the open as part of decision-making and adding new committers. As a mentor of the project it was just a matter of providing guidance in the right direction to go --the team just executed to deliver high quality releases."</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition, Kylin has relationships to several other Apache projects. "We have tightly integrated Apache Calcite as our SQL Engine, and we provided Kylin Interpreter to Apache Zeppelin," added Han. "Also, Kylin is big consumer of Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, HBase and Zookeeper, together with these other key members of the Big Data family, ASF is a natural home for Kylin."</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Global adoption of Apache Kylin</b></div>
<div>Apache Kylin is in use at different organizations world wide, with rapid adoption as a critical analytic platform for the fastest growing Big Data market in China.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"It is great to see Apache Kylin graduate to a Top Level Project within a relatively short period of time," said Seshu Adunuthula, Director of ADI at eBay. "It has been an exciting journey seeing the community evolve around Kylin, adopting it and contributing to its newer capabilities. Several companies in addition to eBay are now using Kylin as their Big Data OLAP engines."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin and its low query latency with ANSI SQL on extreme datasets feature helped us to replace legacy RMDBs of JD.com's JCloud Open API platform, which eliminated the challenges of extreme data growth and smoothly expanding our capacity," said Ling Zhu, Sr. Director of Cloud Platform at JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). "With insight on JOS API statistics data, growing by more than 700 million records every day, Apache Kylin enabled us to do multi-dimensional analysis on tens of billions of reconrds with latency in seconds."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"We have helped many of our customers with Apache Kylin to set up end-to-end business intelligence solutions," said Shicong Feng, CTO at MiningLAMP. "Apache Kylin has proved to be a very useful and powerful tool for multi-dimensional data analysis and reporting in the Big Data area, I would recommend Apache Kylin to anyone interested in making BI solutions on massive amounts of data."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin is the best Open Source project for Meituan's data warehouse requirements among of other analytics technologies, with its great features including sub-second query latency on a billion records with high scalability and seamless integration with BI products," said Wen Li, Sr. Researcher of Engineering and Technology at Meituan.com. "The excellent support from Apache Kylin community enabled Meituan's Big Data team to respond quickly for a variety of needs from multi-product lines. We are looking forward to Apache Kylin continuing their good work and quickly evolving to bring more value to Big Data industry."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Kylin is the best OLAP engine on Big Data so far," said Wilson Pang, Senior Director of Data Services and Solutions at eBay. "At eBay, we collect every user behavior on every eBay screen. While other OLAP engines struggle with the data volume, Kylin enables query responses in the milliseconds. Moreover, we are also starting to leverage Kylin for near real time data streaming storage and analytics engine. All together, Kylin serves as a critical backend component for eBay&rsquo;s product analytics platform."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Working with the Apache Kylin team to bring Kylin through incubation to top-level status has been really exciting for me," said Ted Dunning, Apache Kylin incubator mentor, Vice President of the Apache Incubator, and Chief Application Architect at MapR Technologies. "The technical aspects of Kylin are exciting, of course, but just as exciting is the way that Kylin represents a growing involvement of Asian countries like China in the Open Source community."</div>

<div><b>Availability and Oversight</b></div>
<div>Apache Kylin software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

<div><b>About the Apache Incubator</b></div>
<div>The Apache Incubator is the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to join the ASF enter through the Incubator to: 1) ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards; and 2) develop new communities that adhere to our guiding principles. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
