<meta name="description" content="The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache FlexJS SDK 0.5.0 and Apache Flex FalconJX Compiler 0.5.0. Apache Flex is a highly productive, open source application framework for building and maintaining expressive applications that deploy consistently on all major browsers, desktops and devices (including smartphones, tablets and tv). Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to not only create SWFs but also cross-compile the same MXML and ActionScript to HTML/JS/CSS so applications can run natively in browsers. The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications. Apache Flex FalconJX is a next-generation MXML and ActionScript cross-compiler. It extends the next-generation SWF compiler known as Falcon. Both are contained in the release package and are used by the FlexJS package to compile SWFs or cross-compile to HTML/JS/CSS. This is the third release of FlexJS and FalconJX. It is &lsquo;beta&#39; quality. This release includes some new components, updated integration with Apache Cordova, a few effect classes, drag and drop support, and an example that is a port of the old Flex &lsquo;FlexStore&#39; example. The purpose of this release is to gather feedback about the features and implementation strategies, and recruit new contributors as we grow these code bases into an SDK and tool chain that delivers the highest productivity developing applications that can run in the most places. These releases may not handle production needs. Expect lots of bugs and missing features. Please file bugs at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX For questions about how to use FlexJS and FalconJX, send email to users@flex.apache.org. Please try to prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX] so it is clear the questions refer to this release and not the Flex SDK and MXMLC compiler. For questions and feedback on the development of the source code in these release, send email to dev@flex.apache.org. Again, please prefix the subject with [FlexJS] or [FalconJX]. Apache FlexJS and Apache Flex FalconJX are available in source and binary form from the following download page: http://flex.apache.org/download-flexjs.html When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the downloads using signatures or MD5 hashes. A simple way to try these releases is to use the InstallApacheFlex 3.1 or 3.2 application which is available at the following url: http://flex.apache.org/installer.html Choose Apache FlexJS 0.5.0 and it will create an Adobe Flash Builder-compatible SDK that uses the Falcon and FalconJX compilers to generate SWFs and HTML/JS/CSS output. You can also use FDT as your IDE for developing FlexJS applications. Some folks have been successful using IntelliJ as well. See the README or the FlexJS wiki for more information. The FlexJS section of the wiki is at the following url: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/FlexJS For more information on Apache Flex, visit the project home page: http://flex.apache.org Please try FlexJS and become involved in shaping the future of Flex.
