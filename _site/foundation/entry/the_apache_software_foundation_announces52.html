Apache Allura is an Open Source, extensible, web-based platform that provides integrated software tools for collaborative software development.

Apache Allura features include: integrated issue tracking; markdown formatting, including links to other artifacts (tickets, discussion/comments, commits, etc); artifact subscriptions through mail and RSS; a built-in discussion forum with a granular permission facility that allows for posts either via web or mail;&nbsp; a blog tool with threaded discussion;&nbsp; a code repository that hosts code with git, Mercurial, or Subversion with graphical representation formats Allura allows for accelerated collaborative development across an array of user communities.

It has a modular design to support tools attached to neighborhoods or individual projects. The tools within Apache Allura were designed to support version control for source code repositories, ticket tracking, discussions, wiki pages, blogs and more. Additional external and third-party tools can be installed. &quot;We entered the Allura community to suggest the introduction of new functionalities to improve awareness of people and projects. We found that the community was open to our ideas,&quot; said Elisabetta Di Nitto, Associate professor of the University of Milan. &quot;As a researcher I think this was a very interesting experience.
