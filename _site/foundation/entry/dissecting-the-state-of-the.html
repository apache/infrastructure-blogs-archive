<meta name="description" content="One of the great things about Apache is that we&#39;re all about the individual (contributor). No one has higher rank/status over another.

Titles are for organizational purposes only: a Vice President of a project doesn&#39;t carry any more weight than any other member of a project management committee, for example. We have diverse backgrounds, opinions, and experiences. Each person has their own preferences and personal style, and we celebrate that. Whilst we do adhere to The Apache Way, we don&#39;t impose &quot;corporate conformity&quot; directives on anyone, from our support staff to our executive leadership. As technologists (and perfectionists), we&#39;re trained to look for bugs and are always looking for ways to make things better.

With more than 18 years of successfully honing our process of developing, incubating, and shepherding projects under our belt, we are well prepared to overcome operational demands.
