<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><b><i><span style="font-size: 14px;">by Mark Shan, Chairman of Tencent Open Source Alliance and Tencent Cloud Open Source Ecosystem General Manager</span></i></b></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) manages more than 227 million lines of code, has 206 project management committees, leads more than 350 Apache projects and operates through a merit system, with more than 850 members, 8,100+ committers, and tens of thousands of contributors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Previously the Apache Group, the ASF has grown to one of the largest open source foundations in the world today. It has built the well-known "</span><a href="https://apache.org/theapacheway" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Way</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">" through its leadership, sound community, and merit thinking, resulting in a set of schemes that promote the sustainable development of open source communities and guide the practice of open source projects.</span><span style="color: rgb(26, 26, 26); font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">projects.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="color: rgb(26, 26, 26); font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Since Tencent Open Source was created 11 years ago, a large number of Tencent engineers have formed a deep connection with the Apache community by participating and contributing to Apache projects. Furthermore, by learning from the Apache Way, Tencent is going through its open source journey.</span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">At ApacheCon@Home 2021, I </span><a href="https://youtu.be/8gUH-c92Hy0" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">shared how Tencent thinks, explores, and practices open source</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> according to the Apache Way. Below is a synopsis of this presentation:</span></span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>The Apache Way's Importance in Community Building</b></span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-right: 6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Apache Way is difficult to define. Although the Apache Way has evolved somewhat over the years, the original intention of "high transparency" has remained unchanged. In Mark Shan&rsquo;s view, Tencent's learning experience from the Apache Way can be summarized into five main points:</span></font></p>
<ol>
<li style="line-height: 1.2; margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone has the opportunity to participate and can become a contributor. Contributors can increase their impact and personal growth through their contributions to projects.</span></font></li>
<li style="line-height: 1.2; margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The ASF has a structure that encourages contributions from everyone, regardless of employer. This means that, for example, committer and PMC roles are open to anyone who earns the title. Tencent encourages its engineers to participate in the Apache community actively.</span></font></li>
<li style="line-height: 1.2; margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Understanding and practicing open communication is extremely important. Because open source is the collaboration of a global community, Tencent engineers are able to participate in the Apache open source project through asynchronous collaboration using the mailing list. Code and decision-related communication are open and transparent.</span></font></li>
<li style="line-height: 1.2; margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaching consensus when making decisions is strongly encouraged. Consensus can maintain project momentum and productivity. But when a complete consensus is impossible, voting or other coordination is available to arrive at binding decisions.</span></font></li>
<li style="line-height: 1.2; margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The most important point is that the Apache community's motto, "community over code", is often emphasized. Because a healthy community is more important than simply good code. A strong and healthy community can always correct code problems, while an unhealthy community may struggle to maintain the code repository in a sustainable manner. In addition, flexibility is also an integral part of ASF's sustainable open source success.</span></font></li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent's Open Source Way &mdash;Inspired by the Apache Way<br />
</span></b><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br />
Apache projects and their communities are unique and diverse. In the community-led development process, Apache members formed the Apache Way based on their experience.</p>
<p>Many of Tencent's open source practices and results are executed following the model of the Apache Way. After many years of incorporating open source into its culture, Tencent has formed an approach, "open collaboration, open source for good," which reflects Tencent's value and vision, and is honed based on open source best practices.</p>
<p></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Practicing the Apache Way: Contributing and Donating to open source projects<br />
</span></b><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br />
Tencent engineers have been contributing to and helping to lead many ASF projects, including:</p>
<p></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">1) </span></b></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Big Data</span></b><span style="font-size: 14px;"></p>
<p>Over the past four years, several Tencent engineers helped lead releases for </span><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Hadoop</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> 2.8.4 and 2.8.5, </span><a href="http://ozone.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Ozone</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> 1.0.0 (Ozone was a sub-project of Apache Hadoop, and became a Top-Level Project in 2020), and </span><a href="http://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Spark</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> 2.3.2. Tencent engineers contributed more than 20 features and optimizations to several versions of Hadoop, and are core contributors in multiple Apache computing and AI frameworks that include </span><a href="http://flink.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Flink</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">, </span><a href="http://hbase.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">HBase</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">, </span><a href="https://hive.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Hive</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">, </span><a href="https://mxnet.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">MXNet</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">, and </span><a href="https://parquet.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Parquet</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">.</p>
<p></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">2) </span></b></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Middleware</span></b><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br />
</span></b><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br />
In 2019, Tencent donated TubeMQ, its self-developed trillion-level big data component, to the ASF through the Apache Incubator. In 2021 the project officially changed its name to </span></span><a href="https://inlong.apache.org/en-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache InLong</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">, as part of its incubation process.</p>
<p></span><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent Applications based on Apache Projects</span></b></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition to self-developed tools, Tencent widely uses ASF open source projects in its various business systems, with particular focus in big data, API gateways, and observability. As one of the largest daily real-time computing companies, Tencent&rsquo;s overall big data platform exceeds 5 million cores, and must support single-day access message volume exceeding 55 trillion, real-time computing volume exceeding 65 trillion, and daily analysis tasks reaching 15 million.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap;">More than two dozen Apache projects are used in applications like WeChat, QQ, and Tencent Cloud. These big data projects are used for data transmission, storage, computing, and analysis demand scenarios, supported by other technical fields of service governance that include API gateways and observability.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#1a1a1a" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">For big data, </span><a href="http://ozone.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Ozone</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> is one of the key projects that provides support for Tencent's business scenarios that require large amounts of data and traffic. As early adopters, Tencent's big data platform deployed an Ozone cluster with more than 1,000 nodes as the back-end storage for big data applications and also uses Ozone as the main storage solution for some private data warehouse projects.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; white-space: pre-wrap; color: rgb(26, 26, 26); font-family: Arial;">Today, Tencent is connecting more and more businesses to Ozone, including data warehouses, machine learning platforms, Kubernetes cluster mounting volume, and more. Ozone helps Tencent operate stably, steadily, and at scale: of more than a thousand units without manual operation and maintenance intervention. In the process of verification and improvement, Tencent has done a lot of optimization work to improve performance and stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In addition, </span><a href="http://pulsar.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache Pulsar</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> integrates messaging, storage and functional computing, and it adopts an architecture that separates storage and computing. Pulsar has successfully supported a large number of data and traffic business scenarios within Tencent Cloud and has some practical experience in cloud native environments, such as solving rapid and dynamic expansion and contraction, improving the utilization of cluster resources, and cluster forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For API Gateways, </span><a href="http://apisix.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache APISIX</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> offers high performance, a friendly developer experience, and rich plug-in capabilities, which is why Tencent's internal business chose it. Using APISIX, Tencent internally shares its self-developed cloud system components to solve business pain points and provide efficient API gateway services; externally, Tencent engineers contribute to the Apache APISIX open source community, expanding its influence, and leads the development of the open source community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For Observability, </span><a href="https://skywalking.apache.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache SkyWalking</span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;">'s application in Tencent's internal observable platform provides great convenience for selecting client tracing reporting of the microservices system, as well as the mechanism of computing storage separation and multi-layer query to provide very excellent performance output.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Building Tencent Open Source with 3 Major Projects</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In addition to sponsoring the ASF at the Platinum level, Tencent is currently active in more than 10 foundations worldwide as a top member, including the Linux Foundation and the CNCF Foundation. Tencent is actively involved with open source communities such as Kubernetes, Spring Cloud, MariaDB, and it is also promoting the implementation of open source projects, products and solutions.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Foundations provide intellectual property management framework, code repositories, issue tracking, technical guidance, project governance, financial and public relations, and other services. By participating in these foundations, Tencent has learned many more mature open source organizational governance models and used them to guide the process to open source its internal projects to the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent has open sourced more than 130 independent cloud native, big data, artificial intelligence, database, and other projects to the world. These projects obtained more than 370,000 GitHub Stars, and have exceeded 2,000 contributors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">By open sourcing projects across internal departments and to the world, actively collaborating with developers and communities around the world, and training open source talents, Tencent's open source ecosystem continuously improves and grows.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent Cloud&rsquo;s future will focus on further strengthening the construction of Tencent's open source ecosystem through three major projects:</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">1) WeOpen: Tencent Open Source community</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent Cloud aims to build WeOpen, a platform for open source communication, promotion, and project incubation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">WeOpen is committed to connecting enthusiasts, practitioners, and leaders with global open source foundations to initiate new projects, co-create communities, and hold activities that extend open source culture and inspire the global open source ecosystem to flourish.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">2) Establish an industry open source joint laboratory</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The open source laboratory is the landing place for the actual projects. Tencent Cloud plans to successively establish industry joint open source laboratories with well-known Chinese universities and open source organizations to provide a platform for students, researchers, and developers in the enterprise to contribute code and scenarios for open source projects to realize in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Starting with the "Rhino Bird Open Source Talent Cultivation Plan" held by Tencent this year, open source courses and practice training programs for college students help popularize open source culture, encourage contributions, and further the open source talent ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">3) Release "Cloud Native Open Source White Paper"</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">At the Cloud Native Industry Conference last May, Tencent Cloud and China's Institute of Information and Communications Technology announced the official preparation of the Cloud Native Open Source White Paper, which is expected to be released by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bl-xVKyBoFOvSN10lNZBGdrkR7QXOOqeaIwRPpVPXfVabUl9-CrOSWgjLBf9PM2T3WLp04QkoJDPBeTe2LdkfxJPPMOPcVOz0PlFhZndzd0Qf5YpVRYg8IwWbhMfNrFufI6uaCrO" width="624" height="345" style="color: rgb(26, 26, 26); font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Tencent welcomes open source practitioners and companies to join their efforts in the above projects.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14px;">Conclusion</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For more than 22 years, the ASF has proven that the Apache Way is one of the best practices for building an open organization that balances organizational structure and flexibility. Tencent continues to expand its own open source concepts, methodology, and ecosystem building, with plans to participate in more universities, companies, and organizations, while embracing the Apache Way into the future.</span></p>
