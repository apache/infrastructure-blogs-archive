    <p>Now that we have our <a title="Apache Isis 0.1.2 (incubating)&nbsp;Released" href="http://danhaywood.com/2011/07/18/apache-isis-0-1-2-incubating-released/" data-mce-href="http://danhaywood.com/2011/07/18/apache-isis-0-1-2-incubating-released/">first release of Apache Isis</a> out of the door, I've been spending some time on&nbsp;<a title="Restful Objects" href="http://restfulobjects.org/" data-mce-href="http://restfulobjects.org/">Restful Objects</a>, which forms the basis of the <a title="Apache Isis JSON Viewer" href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis/viewer/json/index.html" data-mce-href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis/viewer/json/index.html">JSON viewer</a> within Isis.</p> 
    <p>The idea of Restful Objects&nbsp;is to provide a standard, generic RESTful interface for domain object models, exposing representations of their structure using JSON and enabling interactions with domain object instances using HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.</p>

    <ul> 
      <li>the start page provides links to the set of registered services/repositories</li> 
      <li>from these services, references to domain object instances can be obtained</li> 
      <li>each domain object has properties, collections and actions</li> 
      <li>the usual business rules (hiding, disabling and validating) are supported</li> 
      <li>actions (idempotent or non-idempotent) can be invoked</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>More generally, you'll see that all the representations are fully self-describing, opening up the possibility of generic viewers to be implemented if required, eg in languages such as HTML5/Ajax, Flex, Silverlight etc etc.</p> 
    <p>Alternatively, the representations can be consumed directly by a bespoke application.</p> 
    <p>One of the nice things about this specification is that it is completely language-independent. &nbsp;As you might expect, I'll be implementing this specification through the Isis JSON viewer, and using that implementation to refine the spec. &nbsp;In addition Richard Pawson is hoping to commit to working on a similar implementation for <a title="Naked Objects MVC" href="http://nakedobjects.net/" data-mce-href="http://nakedobjects.net">Naked Objects MVC</a> (he's a co-author on the Restful Objects site).</p> 
    <p>And, if you know of or are the author of another naked objects-style framework, eg written in Ruby or Python, and the idea of Restful Objects interests you, then I'd love to hear from you.</p></span>
