<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html" title="ASF Incorporation">ASF
incorporator</a> and founding Chairman Roy Fielding reminded <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/members.html" title="ASF Members">us</a> of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#why" title="ASF Mission">ASF’s
mission</a> as created ten years ago.</p>

<p>ASF Board member Bertrand Delacretaz then suggested we post
it here on the ASF blog to reinforce the fact that, in spite of its tremendous
growth, the ASF hasn’t strayed from its roots; still remaining true to its
original vision. We couldn’t agree more. Here’s to the next 10 years!</p>
