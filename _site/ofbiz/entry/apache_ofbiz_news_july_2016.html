<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News July 2016 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about the new build system in our trunk, the introduction of unit tests, ongoing support for our unreleased branches and the community selects a new logo. Changeover from Ant to Gradle in the OFBiz Trunk As mentioned in our last update, a patch was being prepared to changeover our existing build system (Ant) to Gradle. A key driver of the change was to remove external dependencies from the source code. In future releases Gradle will automatically download any dependencies. A lot of hard work was done and during July the patch was applied to the trunk. This is a significant step for the project as this is a major change. Thanks to everyone who helped with reviewing, testing, and removal of dependencies. Ensuring that all the existing functionality available with Ant and was also was available in Gradle is still ongoing, with some clean-up also being done. There are still a few dependencies left to remove and work is in progress to finalise these. Introduction of Unit Tests Our existing code made use of integration tests rather than unit tests. With the change to Gradle, we now have the ability to introduce unit tests and Test Driven Development (TDD). This is something that will improve the quality of the code and also ensure that developers make sure their code is tested. The unit test setup is now in place in the trunk and an initial patch with unit tests for the start component has been submitted. All developers are being encouraged to begin writing and including more unit tests. Support for 14.12 and 15.12 With the change of build system in the trunk, it was important that current users and service providers have access to extended support for the existing codebase. There are currently two unreleased branches 14.12 (created in December 2014) and 15.12 (created in December 2015) that our service providers and developers have been customising for their customer implementations. To ease the transition and to keep the impact low, the community has agreed to backport bug fixes and improvements into these branches until July 2017. New Project Logo This month the community has been discussing whether or not to change the project logo. The OFBiz trademark registration has been finalised and this seemed a good point to talk about any potential changes. Changing a logo is a significant move as it forms part of the project identity so after a lot of community discussion, three potential design options were selected for a community vote. They were as follows: Option 1: Based on our Existing Logo Option 2: Based on Correct Project Name Spelling and New ASF Feather Option 3: Based on our old OFBiz Power Button Anyone from the community could vote and the vote was open 5 days. The results were summarised at the following wiki page: OFBiz Logo Survey Results The most popular selection was Option 3 which uses the icon that was used in the original OFBiz logo when the project first came to Apache. The icon has been re-worked to use the same colours as the new ASF feather. New Features and Improvements Functional enhancements and improvements as well as updates of third party libraries and source code refactoring: Improved the distortion in the UI of the payment section when there is a billing account present for a customer while placing a sales order (OFBIZ-7484) Enforced noninstantiability to multiple classes (OFBIZ-7601) (OFBIZ-7588) (OFBIZ-7562) (OFBIZ-7551) (OFBIZ-7690) (OFBIZ-7715) (OFBIZ-7732) (OFBIZ-7590) (OFBIZ-7600) (OFBIZ-7710) (OFBIZ-7733) (OFBIZ-7593) (OFBIZ-7630) (OFBIZ-7541) (OFBIZ-7740) (OFBIZ-7685) (OFBIZ-7742) (OFBIZ-7687) (OFBIZ-7688) (OFBIZ-7686) (OFBIZ-7744) (OFBIZ-7689) (OFBIZ-7691) (OFBIZ-7684) (OFBIZ-7692) (OFBIZ-7708) (OFBIZ-7716) (OFBIZ-7717) Added content lookup when adding Content to Product Config Item (OFBIZ-7629) Removed Google Checkout and Google Base components from specialpurpose as they were discontinued (OFBIZ-7705) (OFBIZ-7727) Removed HtmlScreenRenderer Class after removing its dependency (OFBIZ-7635) Removed HtmlFormRenderer Class after removing its dependency (OFBIZ-7634) Replaced Apache Ant with Gradle (OFBIZ-7534) Allowed Gradle to generate JavaDocs even if they contain bad formatting (OFBIZ-7775) Renamed generated *ofbiz-gradle.jar* to *ofbiz.jar (OFBIZ-7893) Created a (short term) Gradle &quot;cleanAnt&quot; task to remove old build dirs (OFBIZ-7898) Hidden user inputs for Location/Lot# for fully issued components against production run task (OFBIZ-7522) Added new entity Check as payment method (OFBIZ-7682) Added a look-up for Product Id at &quot;Add Product Store Surveys&quot; screen (OFBIZ-7702) Migrated promotext.properties to UiLabels (OFBIZ-7297) Reformatted multiple FTLs for better readability, no functional changes (OFBIZ-7678) (OFBIZ-7679) (OFBIZ-7636) Added a new procces on entity-auto for &quot;create invocation&quot; to automatically populate the field &quot;changeUserLoginId&quot; and &quot;statusDate&quot; for EntityStatus.

Changeover from Ant to Gradle in the OFBiz Trunk As mentioned in our last update, a patch was being prepared to changeover our existing build system (Ant) to Gradle. A key driver of the change was to remove external dependencies from the source code. In future releases Gradle will automatically download any dependencies. A lot of hard work was done and during July the patch was applied to the trunk. This is a significant step for the project as this is a major change. Thanks to everyone who helped with reviewing, testing, and removal of dependencies. Ensuring that all the existing functionality available with Ant and was also was available in Gradle is still ongoing, with some clean-up also being done. There are still a few dependencies left to remove and work is in progress to finalise these. Introduction of Unit Tests Our existing code made use of integration tests rather than unit tests. With the change to Gradle, we now have the ability to introduce unit tests and Test Driven Development (TDD). This is something that will improve the quality of the code and also ensure that developers make sure their code is tested. The unit test setup is now in place in the trunk and an initial patch with unit tests for the start component has been submitted. All developers are being encouraged to begin writing and including more unit tests. Support for 14.12 and 15.12 With the change of build system in the trunk, it was important that current users and service providers have access to extended support for the existing codebase. There are currently two unreleased branches 14.12 (created in December 2014) and 15.12 (created in December 2015) that our service providers and developers have been customising for their customer implementations. To ease the transition and to keep the impact low, the community has agreed to backport bug fixes and improvements into these branches until July 2017. New Project Logo This month the community has been discussing whether or not to change the project logo. The OFBiz trademark registration has been finalised and this seemed a good point to talk about any potential changes. Changing a logo is a significant move as it forms part of the project identity so after a lot of community discussion, three potential design options were selected for a community vote. They were as follows: Option 1: Based on our Existing Logo Option 2: Based on Correct Project Name Spelling and New ASF Feather Option 3: Based on our old OFBiz Power Button Anyone from the community could vote and the vote was open 5 days. The results were summarised at the following wiki page: OFBiz Logo Survey Results The most popular selection was Option 3 which uses the icon that was used in the original OFBiz logo when the project first came to Apache. The icon has been re-worked to use the same colours as the new ASF feather.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News July 2016 </h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about the new build system in our trunk, the introduction of unit tests, ongoing support for our unreleased branches and the community selects a new logo.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>Changeover from Ant to Gradle in the OFBiz Trunk</h2>
<p>As mentioned in our last update, a patch was being prepared to changeover our existing build system (Ant) to Gradle. A key driver of the change was to remove external dependencies from the source code. In future releases Gradle will automatically download any dependencies.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work was done and during July the patch was applied to the trunk. This is a significant step for the project as this is a major change. Thanks to everyone who helped  with reviewing, testing, and removal of dependencies. Ensuring that all the existing functionality available with Ant and was also was available in Gradle is still ongoing, with some clean-up also being done. There are still a few dependencies left to remove and work is in progress to finalise these. </p>

<h2>Support for 14.12 and 15.12 </h2>
<p>With the change of build system in the trunk, it was important that current users and service providers have access to extended support for the existing codebase. There are currently two unreleased branches 14.12 (created in December 2014) and 15.12 (created in December 2015) that our service providers and developers have been customising for their customer implementations. To ease the transition and to keep the impact low,  the community has agreed to backport bug fixes and improvements into these branches until   July 2017. </p>
