<p>This week we're holding the Apache: Big Data and ApacheCon North America events in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Although the event is still on-going, I wanted to mention a few highlights of the event for those of you who missed it.</p> 
  <p>Attendance has grown 51% over our event in Austin last year, with 675 Apache enthusiasts in attendance.</p> 
  <p>Keynotes from the events may be found on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthvmTSlmIcMH93LIJNe-2w">event YouTube channel</a>, and audio from the conference sessions may be found on <a href="http://feathercast.apache.org/tag/apacheconna2016/">FeatherCast</a>.</p> 
  <p>During the event, we announced ApacheCon EU 2016, to be held November 14-18 in Seville (Sevilla) Spain. We will have a website, with registration and CFP, up within the next few days. Mark the date in your calendar, and plan to attend. It's going to be even better than lst year. If your company wishes to sponsor ApacheCon, we'd be glad to send you a prospectus for the event. If you're wondering why you should sponsor, <a href="http://feathercast.apache.org/why-did-you-sponsor-apachebigdata/">listen to some of this year's sponsors</a> for their reasons.</p> 
  <p>We're considering several locations for ApacheCon North America 2017. Watch <a href="http://apachecon.com/">apachecon.com</a> for updates!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ApacheCon is the place to come to learn what Apache projects are doing, as well as a place for projects to come to build stronger project communities, as well as forge the bonds between projects.</p> 
    <p>ApacheCon is 18 years old, and we've held 32 events in North America, Europe, and Asia. We bring together 350+ projects across many technology spaces, and developers from more than 100 countries who collaborate on these projects</p> 
    <p>Companies who sponsor ApacheCon gain visibility with the developers who make these projects happen, as well as having a chance to showcase their technologies to our user community. Sponsors of past events include Apple, Google, Microsoft, Red Hat, Canonical. HP, IBM, and many, many others.</p> 
    <p>Topics covered include big data, community governance, geospatial computation, web services, and many, many more, as well as an extensive &quot;hallway track&quot;, where communities and relationships are forged and strengthened.</p>
