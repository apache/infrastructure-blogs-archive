The Apache OpenOffice project is proud to help commemorate International Mother Language Day on February 21. &nbsp;Read more about why this day is important, how OpenOffice supports linguistic diversity, and how you can help. Why February 21 was chosen?&nbsp; February 21st was declared as International Mother Language Day (IMLD) by UNESCO. &nbsp; IMLD originated as the international recognition of Language Movement Day, which has been commemorated in Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) since 1952, when a number of Dhaka university students were killed by the Pakistani police and army in Dhaka during the Bengali Language Movement. This is the only event where people gave their lives to preserve the independence of using their mother language. To remember them there is a monument named Language Martyr&#39;s Monument (Shahid Minar) in Dhaka University, Bangladesh. Every year more than a million people give flowers there. This is a big event in Bangladesh. Many foreigners visit Bangladesh just to experience the way the Bangladeshi people give respect to those brave hearts.

Our most recent release of Apache OpenOffice, version 4.0.1, supported 32 languages, including Basque,&nbsp; Khmer, Lithuanian, Polish, Serbian Cyrillic, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Asturian, Czech, Dutch, British English, American English, Scottish Gaelic, Hungarian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Tamil. Our 4.1 release, expected to be available in beta form soon, will include several new translations, including Hindi, Bulgarian, Kazakh, Danish, Norwegian and Thai. Although these translations are all done by community volunteers we aim for professional quality and only release support for a language when the UI is 100% translated.&nbsp; We have many translations-in-progress which might also make it into 4.1, depending on their progress towards completion.&nbsp; For example: Uyghur (97% complete), Hebrew (96% complete), Indonesian (95% complete,) Icelandic (95% complete), Catalan (95% complete), Arabic (94% complete), Ukrainian (84% complete) and so on.&nbsp; Altogether we have support (complete or in-progress) for 111 languages.
