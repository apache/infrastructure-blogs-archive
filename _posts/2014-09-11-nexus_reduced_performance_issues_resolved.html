<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HI All,</p>
<p>So Tuesday morning we got a report in IRC that a committer was trying to get a release out <br />and could not deploy. Shortly after a Nexus issue was reported in Jira INFRA-8321. A few <br />hours later another issue INFRA-8322 related to Nexus was opened. So far, nothing unusual <br />about that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more issues reported on IRC/HipChat, and more issues opened.<br />(INFRA-8326,INFRA-8327,INFRA-8328, INFRA-8334). By then it was obvious this more than <br />a coincidence and it was already being looked into.</p>
<p>Twitter notifications and emails were sent out declaring the degraded performance an outage <br />and On Call was full time looking into the issue. Others joined the call to assist and eventually <br />the outage was determined to be a change to LDAP configuration made 2 days ago by Infra.</p>
<p>(See infra:r921805 for the revert of that.)</p>
<p>The LDAP change was made to improve response times as it was being reported as being slow<br />to return queries. Reverting the change cured the issues Nexus was having contacting the <br />groups that committers belonged to.</p>
<p>There will be another avenue looked into for improving LDAP query response times whilst not <br />affecting those services that connect via anon bind.</p>
<p>Infra thanks everyone for their patience whilst this was looked into and resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks go to those involved in working towards the solution:-</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
