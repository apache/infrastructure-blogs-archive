You can find the code at https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/log4j2/trunk. Log4j 2.0 supports Java 5.0 and has many interesting features including: Support for using the SLF4J or Commons Logging APIs Configuration via JSON (as well as XML) Automatic reloading of configurations without losing logging events Plugin architecture that allows new components to easily be added Allows variables from System Properties, MDC, Log event data, and more to be accessed in the configuration Your help would be greatly appreciated!
