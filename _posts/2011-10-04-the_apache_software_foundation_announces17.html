<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><i><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">Groundbreaking,<br />
lightweight, scalable, all-Apache stack ideal for use in<br />
enterprise-grade Cloud applications</font></b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font size="3"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">The<br />
Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers,<br />
stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and<br />
initiatives, today announced that Apache TomEE has obtained<br />
certification as Java EE 6 Web Profile Compatible Implementation.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">Making<br />
its certification debut at JavaOne, Apache TomEE (pronounced "Tommy")<br />
is the Java Enterprise Edition of Apache Tomcat (Tomcat + Java EE =<br />
TomEE) that unites several quality Java enterprise projects including<br />
Apache OpenEJB, Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache OpenJPA, Apache MyFaces<br />
and more.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">"It<br />
is with great pride that we're announcing Apache TomEE as a certified<br />
implementation of the Java EE 6 Web Profile," said David<br />
Blevins, Vice President of Apache OpenEJB and original co-developer<br />
of TomEE. "Apache TomEE is the newest addition to the Java EE<br />
server space, standing alongside the likes of GlassFish, JBoss, and<br />
Apache Geronimo."</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font size="3"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">Developers<br />
build applications using Java EE-certified products to ensure<br />
portability across Java Enterprise Edition-compatible solutions.<br />
Apache TomEE is one of only six certified implementations available<br />
to the industry today. </font> </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Redefining<br />
Enterprise Cloud; Unifying Communities</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">The<br />
three core design objectives for TomEE were: 1) do not alter Tomcat;<br />
2) maintain simplicity; and 3) avoid architecture overhead. This<br />
enables developers to quickly and easily build highly performant<br />
lightweight enterprise solutions using leading Apache projects<br />
without the need for complex modifications or customization. Apache<br />
TomEE's integration of Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache MyFaces, Apache<br />
ActiveMQ, Apache OpenJPA, and Apache CXFis simple, to-the-point, and<br />
focused on the singular task of delivering the Java EE 6 Web Profile<br />
in a minimalist fashion.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">The<br />
simple, all-Apache stack is both incredibly light and fully<br />
embeddable, making it ideal for testing and usage in today's<br />
evolution of the enterprise Cloud, where the key to scalability is<br />
hundreds of tiny servers, as opposed to the traditional definition of<br />
how large your servers. Apache TomEE boasts groundbreaking<br />
performance in the following areas:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font size="3"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">-<br />
Size: exceptionally small (about 24MB for the entire Web profile),<br />
consumes very little resources;  </font> </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">-<br />
Memory: TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) passed with no additional<br />
memory settings beyond the default &ndash; a first in Java EE; and</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">-<br />
Speed: runs exceptionally fast in embedded mode:<br />
start/deploy/test/undeploy/stop in 2-3 seconds.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">"No<br />
longer do developers have to ask 'Do we use Tomcat or Java EE?' at<br />
the start of a project, as has been the case for the last 10 years,"<br />
explained Blevins. "These two camps have historically been<br />
separate, and certification is a major step in unifying these<br />
communities. With TomEE, developers can now retire untested legacy<br />
stacks and use a reliable product that doesn't deviate from the<br />
Tomcat that they know and love."</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3">Blevins<br />
and members of the Apache OpenEJB community will be presenting<br />
several sessions, including "TomEE &ndash; Tomcat with a Kick",<br />
in the "Servers/Tomcat &amp; Geronimo" track at ApacheCon,<br />
7-11 November 2011, in Vancouver, Canada.  To register,<br />

TomEE software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is<br />
overseen by the Apache OpenEJB Project Management Committee (PMC)<br />
that guides the Project's day-to-day operations, community<br />
development, and product releases. Apache TomEE is certified on<br />
Amazon EC2 t1.micro, m1.small, and m1.large 32bit images;<br />
certification on 64bit EC2 images and other Cloud platforms are in<br />
the Project's future plans. Those Cloud vendors wishing to donate<br />
resources for TomEE to be certified on their platforms are encouraged<br />
to contact the Apache OpenEJB Project for information on how to<br />
participate. Apache TomEE source code, documentation, mailing lists,<br />
