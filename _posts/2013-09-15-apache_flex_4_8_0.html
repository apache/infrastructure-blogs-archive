  content: "In the latest release that you're working on are you going to make sure
    that the compiler works with the latest version of iOS?  We are currently experiencing
    a lot of difficulty trying to get our mobile flex app to compile in iOS. As a
    result we can't submit our iPad app into the Apple App Store. \r\n\r\nPlease advise.
    Thanks!"

<p>The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache Flex<br />
4.8.0-incubating!</p>
<p>Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash<br />
Platform-based applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.</p>
<p>This is the first release under the Incubator of the Apache Software<br />
Foundation and represents the initial donation of Adobe Flex 4.6 by Adobe<br />
System Inc.  Note that because Apache Flex is under "incubation", Apache<br />
Flex is not an official Apache Project, and this is not an official Apache<br />
release.  For more information see the DISCLAIMER file in the release.</p>
<p>This release marks the start of a new era for Flex.  The future of Flex is<br />
now driven by the community instead of a corporation.  Users can have<br />
important bugs fixed or new features added by contributing the code<br />
themselves.</p>
<p>Apache Flex is available in source form from the following download page:</p>
<p>     http://incubator.apache.org/flex/download.html</p>
<p>When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the downloads<br />
using signatures found on the Apache site:</p>
<p>     http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/flex/KEYS</p>
<p>Apache Flex release packages are different from Adobe release packages.  For<br />
information on how to use Apache Flex with existing IDEs, see:</p>
<p>     http://incubator.apache.org/flex/packager.html</p>
<p>For more information on Apache Flex, visit the project home page:</p>
<p>     http://incubator.apache.org/flex/</p>
<p>Thank you for using Apache Flex,<br />
The Apache Flex Community.</p>
