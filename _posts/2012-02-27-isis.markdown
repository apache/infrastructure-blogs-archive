<p>Just a quick announcement that last week we put out our second release of <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis" title="Apache Isis (incubating)" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a> from the incubator, namely 0.2.0-incubating.

</p>
  <p>The main theme in this release is to try to simplify things a little, so that would-be users can more easily grok what Isis is about:
</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>We've updated the website, hopefully explaining better what Isis is and what use cases it hits.</li> 
    <li>we now have the <a href="http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo" title="Isis online demo" target="_blank">online demo</a> linked directly from the website.</li> 
    <li>the archetype has also been reworked; rather than have a module for each of the viewers, we've reduced the number of viewers (just HTML viewer and JSON viewer) and put them into a single webapp module.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>You can read full release notes <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis/release-notes-0.2.0-incubating.html" title="Isis 0.2.0-incubating" target="_blank">here</a>.

</p>
  <p>And, as for all Isis releases, the release can be found in the <a href="http://search.maven.org" target="_blank">Maven central repo</a>, you can use the Maven archetype to create a <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis/quick-start.html" target="_blank">quickstart app</a>, or you can <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/isis/downloads.html" target="_blank">download the release</a> and build it from source.

</p>
  <p>By the way, work is well under way on the next release, where the plan is to re-introduce the Scimpi viewer to the archetype, and also to bring in NoSQL (MongoDB) support.

</p>
