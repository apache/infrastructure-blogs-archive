<h3>How I made the graph<br /></h3>
<p></p></p>
<ol>
<li>I started with the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/openoffice-dev/">list archives</a>, downloaded the mbox files extracted the response graph to a text file, with a custom python script, using the python "mailbox" package.</li>
<li>Then I manually cleaned up the data, coalescing multiple mail accounts used by some members.</li>
<li>I used the open source graph visualization package "<a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>" to process the data and draw the graph (layout via the <a href="http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/Fruchterman-Reingold">Fruchterman-Reingold</a> algorithm) and export it to a PNG file.</li>
