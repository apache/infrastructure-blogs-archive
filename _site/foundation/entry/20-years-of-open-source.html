The ASF&#39;s 731 individual Members and more than 7,000 Committers are global, diverse, and often embodies a case of collective humility. We&#39;ve assembled a list of 20 ubiquitous and up-and-coming Apache projects to celebrate the ASF&#39;s 20th Anniversary on 26 March 2019, applaud our all-volunteer community, and thank the billions of users who benefit from their Herculean efforts. 1. Apache HTTP Server Web/Servers. http://httpd.apache.org/ The most popular Open Source HTTP server on the planet shot to fame just 13 months from its inception in 1995, and remains so today due to its ability to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the latest HTTP standards. Serving modern operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS/X, the Apache HTTP Server played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web; its rapid adoption over all other Web servers combined was also instrumental to the wide proliferation of eCommerce sites and solutions. The Apache HTTP Server project was the ASF&#39;s flagship project at its launch, and served as the basis upon which future Apache projects emulated with its open, community-driven, merit-based development process known as &quot;The Apache Way&quot;. 2. Apache Incubator Innovation. http://incubator.apache.org/ The Apache Incubator is the ASF&#39;s nexus for innovation, serving as the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to officially become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation.

<p><strong><em>by Jim Jagielski and Sally Khudairi</em></strong></p>
</p></div>
<div>As the world's largest and one of the most influential Open Source foundations, The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is home to more than 350 community-led projects and initiatives. The ASF's 731 individual Members and more than 7,000 Committers are global, diverse, and often embodies a case of collective humility. We've assembled a list of 20 ubiquitous and up-and-coming Apache projects to celebrate the ASF's 20th Anniversary on 26 March 2019, applaud our all-volunteer community, and thank the billions of users who benefit from their Herculean efforts.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>1. Apache HTTP Server</strong></div>
<div>Web/Servers. <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>The most popular Open Source HTTP server on the planet shot to fame just 13 months from its inception in 1995, and remains so today due to its ability to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the latest HTTP standards. Serving modern operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS/X, the Apache HTTP Server played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web; its rapid adoption over all other Web servers combined was also instrumental to the wide proliferation of eCommerce sites and solutions. The Apache HTTP Server project was the ASF's flagship project at its launch, and served as the basis upon which future Apache projects emulated with its open, community-driven, merit-based development process known as "The Apache Way".</div>

<div><strong>2. Apache Incubator</strong></div>
<div>Innovation. <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">http://incubator.apache.org/</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Apache Incubator is the ASF's nexus for innovation, serving as the entry path for projects and codebases wishing to officially become part of the efforts at The Apache Software Foundation. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects go through the incubation process to ensure all donations are in accordance with the ASF legal standards, and develop diverse communities that adhere to the ASF's guiding principles. Incubation is required of newly accepted projects until their infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. Whilst incubation is neither a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, nor does it indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF, its rigorous process of mentoring projects and their communities according to "The Apache Way" has led to the graduation of nearly 200 projects in the Incubator's 16-year history. Today 51 "podlings" are undergoing development in the Apache Incubator across an array of categories, including annotation, artificial intelligence, Big Data, cryptography, data science/storage/visualization, development environments, Edge and IoT, email, JavaEE, libraries, machine learning, serverless computing, and more.</div>
