<p>Daniel Gruno has recently developed a <a href="https://comments.apache.org/">comments system</a> for Apache projects to use.&nbsp; The purpose of the system is to enable public commentary on project webpages and is already in production use in the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/">httpd</a> and <a href="http://trafficserver.apache.org/docs/">trafficserver</a> projects.&nbsp; This new system nicely complements the ASF CMS system and trivially integrates with it- see <a href="http://comments.apache.org/help.html">http://comments.apache.org/help.html</a> for details.</p> 
  <p>The comment system is now open- enjoy!&nbsp; Please file a jira ticket with INFRA to get started today.</p>
