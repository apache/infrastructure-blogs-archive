  content: "Congratulations!\r\nBut why don't support Multi Country Language in NetBeans
    10?\r\nIn NetBeans 8, I can add \"-J-Duser.language=xx -J-Duser.country=XX\" to
    netbeans_default_options to change display language. But it's not useful in NB10
    ?!\r\nWhat can I do to change display language?"
