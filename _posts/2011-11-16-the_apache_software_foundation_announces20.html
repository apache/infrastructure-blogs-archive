<div><b>The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Geronimo v3.0-beta-1 -&ndash; Leading Open Source Application Server Now Certified Java EE 6 Full- and Web Profile Compatible</b></div>
<div><b><br /></b></div>
<div><b><i>Flexible, modular, and easy to manage, Apache Geronimo is the ideal platform for lightweight server deployments to full-scale enterprise environments, with complete support for Java EE 6 and OSGi programming models</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>16 November 2011 --FOREST HILL, MD--</b> <a href="http://apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>, the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced that <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org/">Apache Geronimo</a> has obtained certification as a compatible implementation of both the Java EE 6 Full and Web Profiles. Apache Geronimo v3.0-beta-1 joins the Java EE 6 Reference Implementation as the only Open Source application server to be compatible with both Full and Web Profiles support.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"We're very happy to announce this significant milestone for the project," said Kevan Miller, Vice President of Apache Geronimo. "In addition to the Java EE 6 capabilities we've added to the product, Geronimo is now restructured to run on an OSGi kernel. Plus, we've added support for an enterprise OSGi application programming model -- a key enhancement for enterprise application developers wishing to take advantage of the modularity, dynamism, and versioning capabilities offered by OSGi".</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Geronimo integrates a number of ASF projects into an easy to manage, flexible, and modular application server. Java EE technologies utilized by Apache Geronimo include: Apache Tomcat, Apache OpenJPA, Apache OpenEJB, Apache MyFaces, Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Axis, Apache Wink, and Apache Bean Validation. OSGi technologies which are contained within Apache Geronimo include: Apache Aries, Apache Felix, and Apache Karaf. This wide array of Apache projects illustrates the breadth and depth of the software solutions developed at the Apache Software Foundation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Our move to OSGi has represented a signficant amount of internal restructuring, but this restructuring leaves us well positioned for future developments," explained Miller. "The Apache Aries, Apache Karaf, and Apache Felix projects have provided us a great base for our Geronimo 3.0 OSGi enhancments. The same is true for the Java EE technologies developed at the ASF: we couldn't have accomplished this without them".</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Availability and Oversight</b></div>
<div>As with all Apache products, Apache Geronimo v3.0-beta-1 is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Apache Geronimo source code, documentation, and related resources are available at <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org/">http://geronimo.apache.org/</a>.</div>
