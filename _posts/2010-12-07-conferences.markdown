<p><i><b>First Apache Unconference in Australia to be held on 11th 
December 2010<br /></b></i><br />Forest Hill, MD - 6 December 2010 – The Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF) and the University of Sydney today announced BarCampApache 
Sydney, the ASF's first event in the Southern Hemisphere.<br /><br />Taking place at 
the University of Sydney's Darlington Centre on 11th December, BarCampApache is 
an attendee-driven event, focusing on &quot;The Apache Way&quot; of developing Open Source 
software. The event is open to the public free of charge.<br /><br />&quot;We are pleased 
to partner with the University of Sydney, whose commitment to sharing knowledge, 
high value collaboration, and next-generation innovation closely aligns with The 
Apache Software Foundation,&quot; said ASF President Jim Jagielski. &quot;Events such as 
BarCampApache helps promote awareness of the tremendous impact of Open Source 
solutions, and an opportunity for members of the technology community to meet, 
network, and learn in an open environment.&quot;<br /><br />The free to attend, one-day 
event will be facilitated by ASF Members Nick Burch, Aristedes Maniatis, Gavin 
McDonald, Noirin Plunkett, and Brett Porter. <br /><br />The BarCampApache program 
will be proposed and decided by the participants themselves. Dozens of Open 
Source professionals, academics, and enthusiasts will address an array of topics 
focusing on Apache products, including open development techniques and best 
practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, as well as engaging with and incubating 
new initiatives within the ASF. The ad-hoc nature of BarCamp sessions allows 
discussions to flow freely and deepen with smaller groups throughout the 
day.<br /><br />BarCampApache Sydney is hosted by the Information and Communications 
Technology centre at the University of Sydney, with additional support provided 
by sponsors Alfresco, Atlassian, IBM, and MaestroDev.<br /><br />For more
