    Apache - for providing us with a stable open source bedrock. Not only for code
    - but also, and perhaps more important, for governance.\r\n\r\nPb."

  content: "Stupid 1000 char limit!!!\r\n\r\nTo \"127.0.0.1\", your angry rhetoric
    seems way over the top to me, a long-time user of CVS, SVN, BZR and other SCMs.\r\n\r\ntl;dr:
    Based upon the collective and individual (\"127.0.0.1\") responses, I actually
    wish *someone* wish vision, talent and time (like David's corp) would just go
    ahead and fork the project...as publicly as possible.\r\n\r\nFull response: http://www.incendiary.ws/node/243"

  content: 'Don''t despair, "127.0.0.1" and Theodore R. Smith: give the Apache tact
    a bit of time, to see if it can reform the aberration. It''s definitely true that
    WANdisco patronage has enabled some fine Subversion committers to get more good
    work done, that''s all good. Their venture into planning on behalf of the community
    was a bit botched (customer meetings without community involvement, for example),
    and the PR was ... well ... PR ... But the whole point of The Apache Way, validated
    by the Apache history, is that graciously extended room to more fully join the
    community is more effective than inflammatory combat. The Foundation has reminded
    us all of where the lines are. Dave has responded with at least some recognition
    of the offensive tone. The best of all possible outcomes would be for WANdisco
    to continue their recent journey into the community in truth. The best of all
    strategies for reaching that outcome is probably a bit more of The Apache Way.'

  content: "And while two open source companies have their little fight over this
    and that, REAL open source projects are making headway in producing crops without
    light, developing methods to produce large amounts of food with very little resources,
    and generally improving the life of mankind on this planet.\r\n\r\nWANDisco and
    Subversion, not only are you doing it wrong but you're doing it in a method embarrassing
    to the open source community. I'm ashamed. You're BOTH acting like a bunch of
    argumentative children."

  content: "Unfortunately following Subversion there are other companies with bad
    attitude AND bad or wrong form of contributions, too.\r\n\r\nTake the \"official\"
    Eclipse project named \"Subversive\" by a company called Polarion. It is totally
    incompatible with any other SVN clients like Tortoise, etc. and makes working
    in teams beyond 2 or 3 people impossible. No wonder, as most evidence (not checking
    the SVN logs at Eclipse.org, but feel free to do so ;-) and whitnesses online
    confirm, there are just one or two active committers to Subversive at all.\r\n\r\nSubclipse
    has become the \"accepted\" Eclipse plugin for Subversion, but unlike Subversion
    itself it doesn't seem maintained by the ASF, nor willing to join Eclipse.org
    either."

  content: Corporations typically have different requirements than open source projects.  While
    that could be reasonably applied to the centralized vs. distributed version control
    debate, it applies doubly to companies supporting open source projects.  How a
    company supports an open source project is a very new, and frequently perilous,
    etiquette.  I was impressed by the tact in the response from the Apache Foundation.  More
    than one company is funding developers working on subversion in addition to those
    doing it gratis.  For the funded, each commit to the project serves both share
    holder value and altruism, so perhaps the narrative around this could be construed
    as competitive enthusiasm.  The project is richer for all efforts inclusive.

    kinda excited about it. \r\nNot anymore. This is a joke David. You don't address
    anything you said and have only served to instill a rift between the community
    and your company. But you know, hey, whatever gets your shareholders off your
    back. You've insulted the community, including defaming very excellent devs, for
    what? Are you twelve? I'm going to apply my \"useless\" time answering mailing
    lists somewhere else. Have fun getting your foot out of your mouth, which I'm
    sure you'll get around to doing because that's what your paid for. You should
    be fired by your board."

  content: "Oh, my. I'm an old Subversion implementer, and submit patches occastionally
    (not all of which are accepted!). The idea that open source projects do not have
    fights, some of them public, is not borne out by my experience or the history
    of other major projects.\r\n\r\nGood luck to WANDisco improving merges and improving
    sitewide management. I'll believe it when I see it. Those were *not* in the original
    design, and will be painful to implement."

<p>WANdisco CEO David Richards <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.wandisco.com/2010/12/20/shaking-up-subversion-by-listening-to-the-user-community-and-then-committing-to-do-the-work/" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">claims without evidence</a> that bogus changes are being committed to the master tree. He wrote: <em>"We ... believe it's unhelpful when certain unscrupulous committers decide to commit trivial changes in large files to simply get their stats up. That behavior has no place in any open source project; it's a bad form </em>[sic]<em> and wastes everyone's valuable time."</em></p>
<p>We are unaware of any such behavior among the Subversion maintainers. Our repository logs are always open for public inspection, yet when <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-users/201012.mbox/%3CAANLkTikG6jcoyML3rc3oAGW2OKxGeGnbeaK1hbVdtWbX@mail.gmail.com%3E" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">asked to show evidence</a>, Richards <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-users/201012.mbox/%3CAANLkTin6f=g5H-B6N-_6AwCgAgnj64QderSN4hSGUzbB@mail.gmail.com%3E" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">refused</a>.</p>

<li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">
<p>The Subversion development team is <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/roadmap.html" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">already working</a> towards the enhancements that WANdisco inexplicably portrays (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.wandisco.com/2010/12/20/shaking-up-subversion-by-listening-to-the-user-community-and-then-committing-to-do-the-work/" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">[2]</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wandisco.com/php/pr.php?rss=0&amp;prdate=2010-12-20" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">[3]</a>) as bold, controversial steps that must be pushed through in the face of (conveniently unnamed) opposition. WANdisco participates in Subversion development along with many parties, and the Subversion project has always welcomed WANdisco's contributions. However, WANdisco alleges that some entities want to impede technical enhancements; at the same time, WANdisco also implies that it is the corporate leader of the project.</p>
<p>Neither is true. Since WANdisco does not cite any sources for their specific claims, we cannot explain them. However, a bedrock condition of participation in Apache Subversion is that an individual contributor can have discussions, submit patches, review patches, and so forth, but that <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/faq.html#corporate-membership" style="border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; ">companies do not have a formal role</a>. Instead, companies get involved by funding individuals to work on the project. WANdisco's false implication that it is in some kind of steering position in Subversion development discredits the efforts of other contributors and companies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; ">In conclusion, we reiterate that we welcome WANdisco's involvement in Subversion, and failure on WANdisco's part to address the above concerns will have no effect on the acceptance of technical work funded by WANdisco. We simply felt it necessary to clarify WANdisco's role in Apache Subversion, for the benefit of our users and potential contributors.</p>
