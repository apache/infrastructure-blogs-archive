<div>Apache Flume is currently undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation. More information on this project can be found at <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/flume" title="Apache Flume">http://incubator.apache.org/flume</a>.</div>

<div>The next generation of Apache&rsquo;s log ingestion framework, Flume NG, has bolted out of the starting blocks. &nbsp;Last Friday, employees from a diversity of enterprises packed Cloudera Headquarters to learn more and to contribute to the project themselves. &nbsp;With over 40 folks attending the hackathon, what&rsquo;s clear is that major enterprises value reliable, performant data ingestion, and that Flume&rsquo;s new branch is well-positioned to make that kind of ingest a reality. &nbsp;During the session, 10 JIRAs were filed, with one resolved, one code review in progress, and four patches in the works. &nbsp;</div>

<div>Cloudera captured the morning session on video and has made it <a href="http://vimeo.com/34003767" title="Video of Apache Flume Hackathon">available</a> for members of the flume user and dev lists and for the community at large. &nbsp;During the morning Teach-In, Flume committers covered NG&rsquo;s design, the mechanics of contributing to the Apache project, and more. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Get a better understanding of NG&rsquo;s design by reading Arvind Prabhakar&rsquo;s recent post, which does a nice job covering the ins and outs of the new framework: <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture" title="Architecture of Flume NG">https://blogs.apache.org/flume/entry/flume_ng_architecture</a>.</p>
