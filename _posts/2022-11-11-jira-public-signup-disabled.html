<p>Today, the Infrastructure Team took the step to disable public signups to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira" target="_blank">ASF Jira</a><br></p>
<p>This was not done lightly. The main reason for this is the amount of spam and spam accounts that are created every day, it has<br>made managing Jira a big effort. In addition, Infra are planning with Atlassian to move to their Cloud service, where account<br>limitations apply; and our current self hosted instance is around 150000 users above the limit required for migration.</p>
<p>Daily spam account creations undermine our efforts to reduce the user counts and so we must stop the creation of the spam <br>accounts themselves, not just the spam issues/comments created from them.</p>
<p>Projects have for a long time wanted a resolution to the spam problems that plague their Jira Projects, often these spam issues<br>and comments go unnoticed, and the added attraction to spammers is that all issues get copied to mailing list archives.</p>
<p>From now on, until such a time as we migrate to Atlassian Cloud, we ask that Projects themselves take on the task of creating<br>the Jira account requests that come in. Projects are encouraged but not required to create a dedicated private mailing list where<br>users can email to ask for an account.</p>
<p>Once an account has been created, that user is then automatically whitelisted to create issues anywhere within our Jira instance.</p>
<p>We appreciate that this is not as convenient as having public signups on, but we must do this in order to move forward and to <br>stop the spam in its entirety</p>
<p>.Any questions or concerns please feel free to email users@infra.apache.org</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>The ASF Infrastructure Team<br></p>
