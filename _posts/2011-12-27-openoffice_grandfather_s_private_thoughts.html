<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I sent out a similar email to our mailing list before<br />
Christmas and before I took a short break to relax with my family and<br />
friends. But it's maybe worth sharing with a broader audience<br />
here on the blog.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Let me first tell you something about<br />
me (Juergen Schmidt=jsc) and to explain the title of this blog. I have been involved in the<br />
OpenOffice project since the beginning and have worked on the source<br />
code before when I started to work for StarDivision in 1997. So I can<br />
for sure argue that I am one of <b>many</b> grandfathers of the<br />
OpenOffice project and that the last year or better the last 16 month were<br />
not the most brilliant in the long and successful history of the<br />
OpenOffice project.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A lot of misunderstanding and<br />
miscommunication led to confusion by our users and before we start<br />
in a challenging new year I would like to share some thoughts with<br />
you about the last months, my private expectations, and my wishes for<br />
the next year. </p>
<p>Oracle's announcement to stop their investment<br />
in OpenOffice.org was a shock for me. Well the reason is obvious, I<br />
was paid by Oracle and worked on this project. The people who know me<br />
from the past know that I am a 100% OpenOffice.org guy and I always<br />
appreciated to work on this project and together with our community.<br />
I always felt as part of the overall community. I know the reasons<br />
that were responsible for the LibreOffice fork and the split of the<br />
community and I have to confess that I can understand it. But I<br />
didn't like how it was done. If Oracle would have done this step 6<br />
month earlier I am sure we wouldn't have this fork and we wouldn't<br />
have this split of the community. We would potentially still have the<br />
go-oo fork which was the foundation for LibreOffice but that is<br />
something different. Anyway it is as it is at the moment and we will see<br />
how it moves forward in the future. </p>
<p>The grant to Apache was<br />
at least the appropriate signal that OpenOffice.org as a project will<br />
never die. The brand is too big and too important, the opportunities<br />
around the product and the overall eco-system are great and I am very<br />
sure that the project will continue and will be hopefully shining<br />
brighter than before. </p>
<p>But a lot of work was and still is in<br />
front of us. We had to deal with a lot of things in parallel where<br />
other derivative projects didn't had to deal with at least not in public. We had to migrate the whole OpenOffice.org infra-structure to<br />
Apache and had to ensure that it worked. I think we were very<br />
successful here and have migrated nearly everything we need from a<br />
technical perspective.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Our mission was to migrate as much as<br />
possible of the available stuff on <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">www.openoffice.org</a><br />
and at least save it for later use. I think we did it! Thanks to all<br />
who made this possible. And we can concentrate in the future on some<br />
structural and conceptual redesign of the main portal page<br />
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">www.openoffice.org</a> to<br />
provide the information to our users that they need to find the<br />
product, to find more information like help, discussion forums, and to<br />
find the way in the community if they want to do more etc. </p>
<p>We<br />
couldn't simply use the code as it was and could continue with the<br />
development as in the past because of the different license. A huge<br />
challenge that is still ongoing and where I had many problems at<br />
the beginning. It is not easy to explain why you remove something and<br />
replace it with something new that provide the same functionality but<br />
is under a more appropriate license. It's simply boring work and no<br />
developer really likes it. But is a prerequisite for Apache and in the<br />
end it is better for our eco system because the Apache license is<br />
much friendlier for business usage as any other open source license.<br />
As an individual developer I don't care too much about all the<br />
different open source licenses, as long as the work I do is good for<br />
the project and in the end for our users. But I learned that the<br />
Apache license can be a door opener for more contributors and more<br />
engagement of companies. I think that is important and I am confident<br />
that it will help to drive our project forward. </p>
<p>And not<br />
everything is bad. With the IP cleanup we really cleaned up many<br />
things and Armin's replacement for the svg import/export is the best<br />
solution we ever had for OpenOffice and with the biggest potential<br />
for further improvements. All this is really motivating for the<br />
future! </p>
<p>Well we had a lot of noise and communication problems<br />
on our mailing lists and I think we missed transmitting the message<br />
that OpenOffice.org has found a new home under the Apache foundation<br />
and we have missed communicating the progress we have made in the<br />
pubic. <i>We can do much better in the future!</i> And I am looking forward<br />
to working with all of you on this communication part in the future. We<br />
don't have to be shy, we work on a great project with a great product<br />
and we should have enough to communicate and to share in the public<br />
(not only on our mailing list but on all the modern and very useful<br />
media like Facebook, Google+, twitter, ...) </p>
<p>For the next<br />
year I expect that we find our way to guide and control our project a<br />
little bit better. I expect our first release early next year and<br />
hopefully a second one later in the year where we can show that we are<br />
able to drive the project forward and that we are able to create and<br />
establish a vibrant and living community. </p>
<p>I wish that we can<br />
gain trust in the project and in the Apache way and that it is a good<br />
move forward. Our users simply want the best free, open source office<br />
productivity suite and they don't care about the different licenses.<br />
Enterprise users would like to see a huge and working community with<br />
the participation of a lot of different companies or at least their<br />
employees working on the project. We all know that such a huge and<br />
successful project can only work if we have individual community<br />
members as well as full-time community members. Important is the <b>WE</b><br />
and the <b>TOGETHER</b> that makes open source projects successful.</p>
<p>I heart voices and read emails where people said that Apache<br />
is not able to manage such a huge end user oriented project with all<br />
the necessary things. A strong statement, isn't it. At the beginning I have to confess that I also had doubts and wasn't sure. But as I<br />
have mentioned in an earlier post on our mailing list, I have seen and got<br />
the necessary signals over time that Apache is willing to listen and<br />
is open for changes as well if they make sense for the overall<br />
success of our project and if these changes are aligned with the<br />
overall Apache principles. And I think that is fair enough for all.</p>
<p>The move to Apache is a big challenge for all of us. Apache<br />
had many very successful projects but none of these projects has<br />
such a huge end-user focus like OpenOffice. And of course OpenOffice<br />
is no small or new project. No it is one of biggest and most<br />
successful open source projects ever. And the migration was and is<br />
not easy. But we the community can do it, we as individuals,<br />
everybody can help and we together will do it! </p>
<p>And the Apache<br />
way and the Apache license have proven in the past and with many<br />
successful projects that it is a good way and a good license to<br />
achieve this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For our users I wish that press people<br />
will do a better job in the future to research facts and stories<br />
better or if they prefer to write articles based on first-hand<br />
information that they contact the Apache OpenOffice project<br />
directly. We are here and can help with information! That will<br />
definitely help to avoid further confusion about the future of<br />
OpenOffice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Enough from me for now and I hope that I haven't bothered you with my private thoughts. I wish you all a<br />
happy new year, enjoy these days, take your own break too, load your<br />
batteries for our next challenge in 2012. </p>
<p>Regards </p>
<p>Juergen</p>
