<meta name="description" content="Last week we held the first virtual Apache conference, ApacheCon @Home 2020. We&#39;re still digging through all of the analytics from the event, but we can already tell you that, by any metric, the event was an overwhelming success. We had 5745 registrations for the event from more than 150 countries, spanning every time zone, with the virtual format making content available to attendees who would never have attended an in-person ApacheCon, with 83% of poll responders indicating this was their first ApacheCon ever. We had presentations in Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish, for the first time at an ApacheCon, with online presentation giving us access to many speakers who had never spoken at ApacheCon before. Content was presented in 25 tracks, including Big Data, Groovy, Pulsar, httpd, Community, Incubator, cTAKES, Geospatial, and a first-ever dedicated Mandarin language track. And we had brilliant keynotes from Sheng Wu, Thomas Huang, Camille Fournier, and Edmon Begoli. Another highlight of the event was the Bug Bash hosted by one of our sponsors, Muse.dev. Seven teams competed to fix bugs, across several Apache projects, identified by the Muse.dev code analysis tool. Congratulations to TeamThread who won with an impressive 610 points! If you attended the event (or even if you didn&#39;t!), you can still purchase your ApacheCon @Home 2020 event tshirt. ApacheCon was made possible by our sponsors. Platinum sponsors were Instaclustr, Red Hat, DataStax, VMWare, Apple, Amazon, IBM, and Imply. Gold sponsors were OpenLogic, Cerner, and RX-M. Bronze sponsors were Codethink, US Postgresql Association, and Muse.dev. A huge thank you to them! If you missed the event, don&#39;t worry - we are even now processing the hundreds of hours of videos from the event, and they will appear&nbsp;on our YouTube channel&nbsp;over the coming days. Follow us&nbsp;on twitter&nbsp;to find out when the videos become available." />
