<p>The Apache CouchDB project is pleased to announce the creation of a localization team. The <a href="mailto:l10n@couchdb.apache.org">l10n@couchdb.apache.org</a> mailing list has been set up to cover everything l10n- and i18n-related in Apache CouchDB.</p>
<p>The first steps will be to set up some tools to enable easy translation of the documentation and (at a later point) the administration interface (Futon/Fauxton). We are looking for people who want to help out. Would you like to read the CouchDB documentation in another language, and have some time to spare? Please help out! Bonus points if you have experience with translation or localization-related tools and best practices.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just getting started: we have some ideas on how to get started, but we need more help. If you&rsquo;re interested, please subscribe to <a href="mailto:l10n@couchdb.apache.org">l10n@couchdb.apache.org</a> and let us know!</p>
<p>Cheers from the Apache CouchDB I10n team</p>
