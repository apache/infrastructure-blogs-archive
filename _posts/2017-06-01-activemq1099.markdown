<p><a href="http://activemq.apache.org/images/activemq-logo.png">The Apache ActiveMQ logo</a> was created a few years ago. While the project continues to evolve, the logo needs to be updated to reflect current ActiveMQ technology. So, the PMC has discussed making a “Call For Entry” where you can submit a new ActiveMQ Logo.</p>

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Make your Apache ActiveMQ logo submissions as a PR with your files towards in this folder: 
      <a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img">https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img</a></p>

<p>Current submissions will be seen as <a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/pulls">Pull Requests</a>.</p>

<p>It’s basically a contest where you could win the possibility of saying: “I made that cool logo” :) Also you would get a big thanks from the Apache community.</p>

<p>Apache ActiveMQ is a fast and scalable Apache 2.0 licensed message broker. It’s built around standardized messaging protocols like AMQP 1.0 and MQTT, and standard APIs such as JMS. It’s an ideal fit for the messaging needs of a wide range of projects, from enterprise applications and integration solutions (in combination with Apache Camel) to Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Regardless of having your entry being selected or not, open source is a community experience, where your submission will be part of a bigger discussion. We are really looking forward to this experience and to know your art.</p>

</p>The new Logo submission should have two versions:</p>
<li>An Abstract image, representing ActiveMQ as a Messaging System (preferably square).</li>
<li>A Combined word ActiveMQ with the abstract image you created, like a banner style logo.</li>

<p>Also, it would be nice to have:</p>
<li> .png files to visualize the art you made.</li>
<li>Vector based files (.svg) so anyone would be able to work with the sources of the file and have the image looking nice on any scale.</li>
<br/>
</p>Make your submissions as a Pull Request with your files towards this folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img">https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/docs/img</a></p>

<p>If you are not familiar with git and github you can still attach your submission towards  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6689">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6689</a></p>

</p>The entry will be open for 30 days, until July 1st 2017, before we start a vote which will be open for 1 week.</p>
