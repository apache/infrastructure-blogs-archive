<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">The following newsworthy events took
place during the course of ApacheCon North America 1-5 November:</p> 
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>1) Foundation Updates</b></p>
  <p><u>Membership count</u>: 330 (31 new Members; 52
emeritus)</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><u>Committer count</u>: +2,500 (approximately
200 additional Committers over the past year) </p> 
  <p>The ASF is governed by the community it most directly serves -- the people collaborating within its projects. Apache Committers are developers who contribute (individuals who &quot;commit&quot; or &quot;write&quot; code, patches, or documentation) directly to the Apache code repository. Apache Members are Committers who have demonstrated merit in the Foundationâ€™s growth, evolution, and progress, and have been nominated for and elected to be awarded ASF Membership by existing Members. ASF Members have the right to vote on community-related decisions; and and the ability propose an active user for Committership.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><u>Sponsors</u>: the ASF welcomed new Sponsors
AMD and IBM at the Gold level, and Lucid Imagination at the Bronze
level.</p>
