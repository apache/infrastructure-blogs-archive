<p>We<br />
 received another report on the users mailing list from someone who had<br />
downloaded what he thought was OpenOffice, but instead got a bunch of<br />
malware.&nbsp; That wasn't us, obviously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache OpenOffice does not bundle<br />
 any other programs in its package.&nbsp; Absolutely none.&nbsp; Our downloads are<br />
 carefully scanned for viruses and are accompanied by digital signatures<br />
 and cryptographic hashes to allow users to verify their integrity.</p>
<p>However,<br />
 there are third parties that sometimes take OpenOffice and bundle it<br />
with objectionable and intrusive applications.&nbsp; In some cases they put<br />
up fake websites, or purchase advertisements in search engine search<br />
results, to lure people to their website.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that<br />
such sites often come top of the hit list on search engines;<br />
inexperienced users download from them and their computers become<br />
infected with adware/viruses/trojans. When we know the exact URL of any<br />
such sites we do our best to have these removed or flagged, but it is an<br />
 uphill battle.</p>
<p>We recommend to download only from<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download"> www.openoffice.org/download</a><br />
 which will redirect to SourceForge, whose secure content distribution<br />
network we use.&nbsp; A download from there will usually start within five<br />
seconds.</p>
<p>Typically an OpenOffice download is about 145 MB; we do<br />
not use downloader applications, so any site offering a much smaller<br />
download should immediately be suspect. If in any doubt about a download<br />
 it is best to check its integrity using MD5Sum; details are given at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html">http://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html</a></p>
<p>OpenOffice is a complex and powerful software. If you have difficulties, our User Forums at&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openoffice.org/">https://forum.openoffice.org/</a> in several languages will do their best to help.</p>

<p>Three new translation teams have been established: Catalan, Valencian AVL, Valencian RACV.&nbsp; If you want to help with these, or any other translation, you can find <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html">more information on our website</a>.</p>
<p>The<br />
 Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache OpenOffice has asked Tal<br />
Daniel to become a committer and we are pleased to announce that Tal has<br />
 accepted and taken the ID "tal".</p></p>
