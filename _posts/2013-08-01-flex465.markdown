<p>Come see us at <a href="http://www.360stack.com/">360|Stack</a> in Denver, Aug 4-8.  Several Apache Flex committers will be 
there and you can find us hanging out between sessions in the Apache Flex Discovery 
Room which will be in the Englewood room at the conference hotel.  There will be 
munchies until we run out.</p>

<p>There are still a few tickets left if you can get over to Denver and learn about the latest on
Flex, including a prototype of Flex running in a browser without Flash.  The organizer was 
even kind enough to come up with a special discount code to use when your register to 
save 20%.  Just use "AlexRocks" when registering.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
