  content: 'The Apache Software Foundation is a great community of developers. When
    I hear that America''s engineering is not dominating anymore, I disagree, because
    the strength is in unity, and the Apache community is the best example of  engineering

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Forest<br />
Hill, MD &ndash; 27 September 2011 &ndash;</b><br />
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),  the all-volunteer developers,<br />
stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and<br />
initiatives, today announced the 10th anniversary of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org">Apache Lucene</a>.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The<br />
Lucene information retrieval software was first developed in 1997,<br />
entered the ASF as a sub-project of the Apache Jakarta project in<br />
2001, and became a standalone, Top-Level Project (TLP) in 2005.<br />
Apache Top-Level Projects and their communities demonstrate that they<br />
are well-governed under the Foundation&rsquo;s meritocratic,<br />
consensus-driven process and principles.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">"Ten<br />
years ago, Apache provided Lucene a home where it could build a solid<br />
community. Today we can see the fruit of that community, both through<br />
the wide breadth of Lucene-based applications deployed, and through<br />
the depth of improvements to Lucene made in the past decade,"<br />
said Doug Cutting, ASF Chairman and original Lucene creator.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Apache<br />
Lucene powers smart search and indexing for eCommerce, financial<br />
services, business intelligence, travel, social networking,<br />
libraries, publishing, government, and defense solutions.  </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">"Lucene<br />
has changed the world by opening doors that didn't exist before it<br />
arrived on the Open Source scene,&rdquo; said ASF Member and Apache<br />
Lucene Committer Erik Hatcher. &ldquo;Lucene has massively disrupted the<br />
enterprise/proprietary search market, with wide adoption around the<br />
globe in every industry.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Highly<br />
performant, Apache Lucene is in use across an array of applications,<br />
from mobile to Internet scale, and powers enterprise-grade search<br />
solutions for AOL, Apple, IBM (including its artificial<br />
intelligence-driven supercomputer Watson), LinkedIn, Netflix,<br />
Wikipedia, Zappos, and many other global organizations.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">"When<br />
it arrived to ASF, Lucene immediately made a huge impact --Lucene was<br />
one of those technologies that made a whole generation of businesses<br />
possible-- it was fast, easy to use, free, and had a growing<br />
community of users and developers. Apache Lucene can be found in an<br />
amazing number of products and services we all know and use, as well<br />
as in products and services we have never heard of,&rdquo; said ASF<br />
Member and Apache Lucene Committer Otis Gospodnetic.  </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">"While<br />
it's been six years since I joined the Lucene community, the last two<br />
were certainly the most exciting,&rdquo; said Simon Willnauer, Vice<br />
President of Apache Lucene.  </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Current<br />
Apache Lucene sub-projects are PyLucene and Open Relevance; other<br />
sub-projects, including Droids, Lucene.Net, and Lucy, have spun out<br />
of the project and are undergoing further development in the Apache<br />
Incubator with the intention of becoming standalone TLPs. Solr, the<br />
high-speed Open Source enterprise search platform, has merged into<br />
the Lucene project itself, whilst former Lucene sub-projects Hadoop,<br />
Mahout, Nutch, and Tika have all successfully graduated as autonomous<br />
Apache Hadoop, Apache Mahout, Apache Nutch, and Apache Tika TLPs.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Originally<br />
written in Java, Apache Lucene is available in many programming<br />
languages such as Perl, C#, C++, PHP, Python, and Ruby. &ldquo;Now, 10<br />
years later, Apache Lucene is backed by a large community of users,<br />
contributors and developers with incredible energy poured into Lucene<br />
every hour of every day of the year," said Gospodnetic, who is<br />
also co-author of Lucene in Action, and founder of Sematext<br />
International.  </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Even<br />
after 10 years, it seems this blazing community and codebase hasn't<br />
reached its potential yet,&rdquo; added Willnauer. &ldquo;I'm proud to be<br />
part of this community and look forward to another decade of Open<br />
Source Search."</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Hatcher,<br />
who is also co-author of Lucene in Action and co-founder of Lucid<br />
Imagination, added, &ldquo;if you need search (and you do!), Lucene is<br />
the best core technology choice."</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Hatcher,<br />
Willnauer, and other members of the Apache Lucene community will be<br />
presenting sessions on data handling and analytics &ndash;a.k.a. &ldquo;Lucene<br />
and Friends&rdquo;-- including what's upcoming in Apache Lucene 4.0 (with<br />
performance improvements up to 20,000% from previous versions and<br />
more) at ApacheCon, 7-11 November 2011, in Vancouver, Canada.  To<br />

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Apache<br />
Lucene software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is<br />
overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the<br />
project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&rsquo;s<br />
day-to-day operations, including community development and product<br />
releases. Apache Lucene source code, documentation, mailing lists,<br />

in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred<br />
fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server --<br />
the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's<br />
meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than<br />
350 individual Members and 3,000 Committers successfully collaborate<br />
to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting<br />
