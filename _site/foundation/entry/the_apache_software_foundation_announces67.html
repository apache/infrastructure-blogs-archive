MetaModel&#39;s schema model and SQL-like query API is applicable to databases, CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, NoSQL databases, Cloud-based business applications, and even regular Java objects. This level of abstraction makes MetaModel great for dynamic data processing applications, less so for applications modelled strictly around a particular domain.&nbsp; MetaModel is so called as it&#39;s a model for interacting with data based on metadata, enabling developers to go above the physical data layer and apply their application to just about any data.&nbsp; &quot;MetaModel enables you to consolidate code and consolidate data a lot quicker than any other library out there,&quot; S&oslash;rensen explained. &quot;In these &#39;Big Data days&#39; there&#39;s a lot of focus on performance and scalability, and surely these topics also surround Apache MetaModel.
