<p>Roller was installed today for the use of ASF Projects. Those committers with personal blogs should instead add their feed to planet.apache.org.</p>
<p>Still a few things to sort out, but blogs.apache.org is mostly ready.</p>
<p>Any project that wants a blog, please can a PMC member email infra or create a jira issuse.</p>
<p>Thanks and Enjoy!</p>
