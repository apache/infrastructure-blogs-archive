  content: Guys, I believe some of you have been using Adobe Flash Builder in design
    mode, which was very easy and effective. They removed it in version 4.7 and there
    will be no such a function in further releases. Is there any similar tool with
    the same functionality (or better) going to be developed that we can use in near
    future? Luckily, any open source project? From other hand, which software are
    you using for coding and design?

    + mac, but not for linux ?\r\n\r\nanyway, this is java.. so this might be crossplatform,

    Flex has not made it onto the IPhone or Android or IPad. Is Flex going the way
    of the dinosaur?

    since adobe stating to stop supporting flash player on mobile.Android 4.1. If
    this is the case do Apache will create a player to support flex web application
