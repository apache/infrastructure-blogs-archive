<div><b><i>Bolsters Big Data processing by providing extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as Apache Spark.</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;29 June 2016&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; Bahir&trade; has become a Top-Level Project (TLP).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Bahir bolsters Big Data processing by serving as a home for existing connectors that initiated under Apache Spark, as well as provide additional extensions/plugins for other related distributed system, storage, and query execution systems.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Bahir is a new community that aims to be a place to curate extensions related to distributed analytic platforms following the Apache Governance," said Luciano Resende, Vice President of Apache Bahir and an Architect at IBM contributing to The Apache Software Foundation for over 10 years. "The project is initially offering a few Apache Spark extensions but it is definitely open for expanding to other platforms such as Apache Beam, Apache Flink and others."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bahir code is extracted from the Apache Spark project, and has spun out as a standalone project to provide implementations for different Spark related extensions/plugins, connectors, and other pluggable components. Current extensions include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;streaming-akka (akka:Open Source toolkit and runtime simplifying the construction of concurrent and distributed applications on the Java Virtual Machine)</li>
<li>&nbsp;streaming-mqtt (mqtt: lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks)</li>
<li>&nbsp;streaming-twitter (Twitter: online social networking service; Bahir allows the processing of social data from Twitter)</li>
<li>&nbsp;streaming-zeromq (zeromq: a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications)</li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition, Apache Bahir has a strong relationship with different storage layers; the project intends to extend that relationship to a number of other ASF projects and Apache-licensed initiatives.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"We are very interested in streaming-mqtt for remote sensing applications and control/monitoring. We have a lot of Big Data needs in Earth science especially in remote and difficult to access environments and plugins such as streaming-mqtt from Bahir provide a readily accessible and Apache-based solution to that," said Chris Mattmann, member of the Apache Bahir Project Management Committee, and Chief Architect, Instrument and Science Data Systems Section at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"We are very motivated to increase the size and diversity of the Apache Bahir community," added Resende. "We welcome feedback, use cases, bug reports, patch submissions, code contributions, documentation, new extension proposals, and other ways to participate."</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Availability and Oversight</b></div>
<div>Apache Bahir software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.

<div><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</b></div>
<div>Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than 350 leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server --the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 550 individual Members and 5,300 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including Alibaba Cloud Computing, ARM, Bloomberg, Budget Direct, Cerner, Cloudera, Comcast, Confluent, Facebook, Google, Hortonworks, HP, Huawei, IBM, InMotion Hosting, iSigma, LeaseWeb, Microsoft, OPDi, PhoenixNAP, Pivotal, Private Internet Access, Produban, Red Hat, Serenata Flowers, WANdisco, and Yahoo.
