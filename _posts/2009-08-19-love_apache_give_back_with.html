<div role="main" class="undoreset clearfix" id="message1898410106" style="overflow: visible; visibility: visible;">The<br />
Apache Software Foundation has become a worldwide force in the software<br />
industry because of the diverse programs, applications,and tools built<br />
on its projects such as the HTTP Server, Tomcat, Hadoop, Lucene and<br />
many others. This year, we&rsquo;re celebrating 10 years of the ASF!
<div class="plainMail">
<p>While<br />
the Foundation and committers have kept the innovation coming, it's the<br />
millions of users who have helped make Apache one of the most pervasive<br />
Open Source communities in the world. So, in celebrating the success of<br />
Apache, we&rsquo;re celebrating you. </p>
<p>To recognize the breadth of the<br />
Apache footprint, we're inviting all Apache users to submit a video<br />
telling everyone why you love Apache.&nbsp; Maybe you've created a cool<br />
program, Website or device. Maybe you use Apache at work and it makes<br />
your life a bit easier. Or perhaps you just love hacking on Apache<br />
software. We want to hear all about it! </p>
<p><b>WHO SHOULD SUBMIT?<br /></b><br />MyApache<br />
community video submissions are open for any individual or group who<br />
has used or is using Apache code from any Apache project an in<br />
interesting way.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of videos an<br />
individual or group can submit, but each video must cover a different<br />
Apache use or implementation.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN YOUR VIDEO SALUTE<br /></b><br />Each<br />
MyApache video submission should be no longer than 1 minute in length.<br />
While we encourage you to get creative and play up the humor, any<br />
videos containing inappropriate, distasteful or illegal content will be<br />
disqualified and prohibited from being posted.</p>
<p>MyApache video content should tell the story of who you are as an Apache user and how you have used Apache. </p>
<p>Video content should describe:</p>
<p>1. Things you have created or accomplished with Apache<br />2. Why you love Apache<br />3. Your thoughts and happy anniversary wishes to the Apache Software Foundation (singing &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; is encouraged!)</p>
<p>Your video content can answer a combination of these questions:</p>
<p>Q. Why do I like Apache?<br />Q. Why did I start using Apache? <br />Q. How long have I used Apache?<br />Q. How often do I use Apache?<br />Q. How do I use Apache?<br />Q. Do I use Apache at work, for hobby or other times? <br />Q. What Apache project(s) do I currently work with or have worked with in the past? <br />Q. What was particularly good about those projects or their communities?<br />Q. What and where are some of the improvements I&rsquo;ve seen in Apache since I began using it?<br />Q. How does Apache differ from other Open Source communities?<br />Q. What is my happy anniversary wish to Apache?<br />Q. Why would I like to thank Apache?</p>
