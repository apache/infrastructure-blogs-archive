    Apache Flex does not have a PR and marketing team. You can checkout the project

  content: "Where can I find information on the plans and direction of Apache Flex?\r\n\r\nI
    can see detailed discussions in the email archives, and I can see commits in the
    archives as well, but I have no idea what is being built.\r\n\r\nThere are probably
    many like myself who have made a commitment to build projects in Flex, but at
    the moment do not know whether we should continue in Flex.  A description of plans
    would help.  Otherwise, we may discover too late that we are building in the wrong
    language.\r\n\r\n"

    physical and mental refreshment. I can still remember my unforgettable experience
    when I was in <a href="http://www.bantayan-island.net/">Bantayan Island</a>. The
    place was indescribable. The surroundings were rare, pleasant to your soul.
