<div>In the works over the past year (v2.0 was released May 2010), Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0 is the result of contributions from more than 30 developers and contributors. Technical highlights include:</div>
<p>I. Contributions</p>
<div>- Over 1,000 "commits" (code, patches, or documentation written directly to the code repository);</div>
<div>- 380+ bug tickets resolved;</div>
<div>- 10 releases have been made during the development phase (v2.1.0 - 2.1.9)</div>
<div></div>
<div>II. New features/improvements</div>
<div>- Full 64-bit support;</div>
<div>- Client side IPv6 support;</div>
<div>- WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol);</div>
<div>- Clustering is functional and supported (many benefits include an efficient distributed cache);</div>
<div>- Major plug-in API improvements, making the APIs more feature rich and easier to use;</div>
<div>- Support for many platforms, including OSX, Solaris and FreeBSD (Linux, of course, was always supported);</div>
<div>- New improved RAM cache algorithms, for better performance and memory utilization</div>
<div>- Many configurations are now configurable per transaction (or per mapping rule)</div>
<div>- Many improvements in statistics and management APIs;</div>
<div>- Multiple accept threads, and a dedicated DNS thread:</div>
<div>- Build environment is now much more flexible, and package owner friendly;</div>
<div>- Many, many bug fixes for improved stability and functionality.</div>
<div></div>
<div>III. Performance improvements</div>
<div>- Overall throughput is 2-3x improved over v2.0 (depending on the traffic patterns)</div>
<div>- Response latency is up to 5x better than v2.0</div>
<div>- Benchmark: Serving small objects out of RAM cache, a high end server has showed over 220,000 requests / second</div>
<div>- Benchmark: Serving small objects that are not cacheable, the same high end server could proxy 100,000 requests / second</div>
<div>(NOTE: all benchmarks are on local network, with keep-alive)</div>
