    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>"Open Source Community Leadership Drives Enterprise-Grade<br />
Innovation" showcases dozens of key Apache projects across Big Data, Cloud<br />
Computing, Infrastructure, Messaging, Scientific Applications, and more.</i></b><i><o:p /></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 12 December<br />
2012 &ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers,<br />
stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives,<br />
today announced the program and early registration incentives for ApacheCon<br />
North America 2013, the 25th edition of the ASF's official conference,<br />
trainings, and expo.<o:p /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Taking place 24 February-2 March 2013 at the Hilton Portland<br />
&amp; Executive Tower in Portland, Oregon, ApacheCon is the ideal opportunity<br />
for those developing Apache-based solutions, as well as those interested in committing<br />
code to an Apache project, contributing to the Apache Incubator, or enhancing<br />
their Open Source products and community practices. ApacheCon offers an<br />
excellent way to meet the individual contributors behind some of the industry's<br />
most popular Apache projects through hands-on educational sessions and ample<br />
networking opportunities.<o:p /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This year's theme is "Open Source Community Leadership<br />
Drives Enterprise-Grade Innovation", reflecting the enormous reach and<br />
influence of the ASF. Apache products power half the Internet, petabytes of<br />
data, teraflops of operations, billions of objects, and enhance the lives of<br />
countless users and developers. First held in 1998 for developers and users of<br />
the Apache Server to meet face-to-face, ApacheCon is the public showcase for<br />
Apache innovations, from the ubiquitous flagship Apache HTTP Server to industry-defining solutions in Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Infrastructure, to dozens of emerging<br />
projects in the Apache Incubator and Labs.<o:p /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The event will kick off with two days of pre-conference<br />
trainings, BarCamp, and Hackathon activities, followed by the main conference +<br />
expo 26-28 February, and will close with post-conference sprints, workshops,<br />
and team building events. <o:p /></p>
