<p>In a previous post, we announce the Apache TomEE logo contest.<br />
The purpose is to find a logo that clearly fits the logo philosophy and would allow everybody to identify it.</p>
<p>We already got interesting proposals and decided to extend the logo contest till January, 15th.<br />
Every proposal is welcome and there is no limit!</p>
