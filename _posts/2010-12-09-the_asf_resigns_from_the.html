<p>The Apache<br />
Software Foundation has <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-community/201012.mbox/%3C64C623FF-90E7-48C0-A371-C53B848CB4DE@pobox.com%3E">resigned its seat</a> on the Java SE/EE Executive<br />
Committee.&nbsp; Apache has served on the EC for the past 10 years, winning<br />
the JCP "Member of the Year" award 4 times, and recently was ratified<br />
for another term with support from 95% of the voting community.&nbsp;<br />
Further, the project communities of the ASF, home to Apache Tomcat, Ant,<br />
 Xerces, Geronimo, Velocity and nearly a 100 mainstay java components<br />
have implemented countless JSRs and serve on and contribute to many of<br />
the JCPs technical expert groups.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We'd like to provide some explanation to the community as to why we're taking this significant step.</p>
<p>The<br />
 recent Java SE 7 vote was the last chance for the JCP EC to demonstrate<br />
 that the EC has any intent to defend the JCP as an open specification<br />
process, and demonstrate that the letter and spirit of the law<br />
matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the issues at stake in the vote, we believe that<br />
while continuing to fail to uphold their responsibilities under the<br />
JSPA, Oracle provided the EC with a Java SE 7 specification request and<br />
license that are self-contradictory, severely restrict distribution of<br />
independent implementations of the spec, and most importantly, prohibit<br />
the distribution of independent open source implementations of the<br />
spec.&nbsp; Oracle has refused to answer any reasonable and responsible<br />
questions from the EC regarding these problems.</p>
<p>In the phrase<br />
"fail to uphold their responsibilities under the JSPA", we are referring<br />
 to Oracle's refusal to provide the ASF's Harmony project with a TCK<br />
license for Java SE that complies with Oracle's obligations under the<br />
JSPA as well as public promises made to the Java community by officers<br />
of Sun Microsystems (recently acquired by Oracle.)&nbsp; This breach of the<br />
JSPA was begun by Sun Microsystems in August of 2006 and is a policy<br />
that Oracle explicitly continues today.&nbsp; For more information on this<br />
dispute, see our <a href="http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html">open letter to Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>
<p>This<br />
vote was the only real power the Executive Committee has as the<br />
governing body of the Java specification ecosystem, and as we <a href="http://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/statement_by_the_asf_board1">indicated<br />
previously</a> we were looking for the EC to protect the rights of<br />
implementers to the degree they are able, as well as preserve the<br />
integrity of the JCP licensing structure by ensuring that JCP<br />
specifications are able to be freely implemented and distributed.&nbsp; We<br />
don't believe this is an unreasonable position - it should be noted that<br />
 the majority of the EC members, including Oracle, have publicly stated<br />
that restrictions on distribution such as those found in the Java SE 7<br />
license have no place in the JCP - and two distinguished individual<br />
members of the EC, <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html">Doug Lea</a> and <a href="http://tembrel.blogspot.com/2010/12/resigned-from-ec.html">Tim Peierls</a>, both have resigned in<br />
protest over the same issue.</p>
<p>By approving Java SE 7, the<br />
EC has failed on both counts : the members of the EC refused to stand up<br />
 for the rights of implementers, and by accepting Oracle's TCK license<br />
terms for Java SE 7, they let the integrity of the JCP's licensing<br />
structure be broken.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation concludes<br />
that that JCP is not an open specification process - that Java<br />
specifications are proprietary technology that must be licensed directly<br />
 from the spec lead under whatever terms the spec lead chooses; that the<br />
 commercial concerns of a single entity, Oracle, will continue to<br />
seriously interfere with and bias the transparent governance of the<br />
ecosystem;&nbsp; that it is impossible to distribute independent<br />
implementations of JSRs under open source licenses such that users are<br />
protected from IP litigation by expert group members or the spec lead;<br />
and finally, the EC is unwilling or unable to assert the basic power of<br />
their role in the JCP governance process.</p>
<p>In short, the EC and the Java Community Process are neither.</p>
<p>To<br />
 that end, our representative has informed the JCP's Program Management<br />
Office of our resignation, effective immediately.&nbsp; As such, the ASF is<br />
removing all official representatives from any and all JSRs. In<br />
addition, we will refuse any renewal of our JCP membership and, of<br />
course, our EC position.</p>
