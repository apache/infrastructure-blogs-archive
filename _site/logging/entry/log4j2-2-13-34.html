<meta name="description" content="Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging, property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be &quot;garbage-free&quot; (avoid allocating temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring. The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html. This release contains a fix for bug LOG4J2-2838. Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters. log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and log4j-slf4j18-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later. Note that the default XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the &quot;timeMillis&quot; attribute and instead have an &quot;Instant&quot; element with &quot;epochSecond&quot; and &quot;nanoOfSecond&quot; attributes. If the previous behavior is desired the &quot;includeTimeMillis&quot; attribute may be set to true on each of the respective Layouts. The Log4j 2.13.3 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases. GA Release 2.13.3 Changes in this version include: Fixed Bugs LOG4J2-2838: Fix NullPointerException in ThreadContextDataInjector. Apache Log4j 2.13.3 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6 and Log4j 2.12.1 is the last release to support Java 7. For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Apache Apache Log4j 2 website: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/" />
