<p><i><b>First Apache Unconference in Australia to be held on 11th<br />
December 2010<br /></b></i><br />Forest Hill, MD - 6 December 2010 &ndash; The Apache Software<br />
Foundation (ASF) and the University of Sydney today announced BarCampApache<br />
Sydney, the ASF's first event in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Taking place at<br />
the University of Sydney's Darlington Centre on 11th December, BarCampApache is<br />
an attendee-driven event, focusing on "The Apache Way" of developing Open Source<br />
software. The event is open to the public free of charge.</p>
<p>"We are pleased<br />
to partner with the University of Sydney, whose commitment to sharing knowledge,<br />
high value collaboration, and next-generation innovation closely aligns with The<br />
Apache Software Foundation," said ASF President Jim Jagielski. "Events such as<br />
BarCampApache helps promote awareness of the tremendous impact of Open Source<br />
solutions, and an opportunity for members of the technology community to meet,<br />
network, and learn in an open environment."</p>
<p>The free to attend, one-day<br />
event will be facilitated by ASF Members Nick Burch, Aristedes Maniatis, Gavin<br />
McDonald, Noirin Plunkett, and Brett Porter. </p>
<p>The BarCampApache program<br />
will be proposed and decided by the participants themselves. Dozens of Open<br />
Source professionals, academics, and enthusiasts will address an array of topics<br />
focusing on Apache products, including open development techniques and best<br />
practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, as well as engaging with and incubating<br />
new initiatives within the ASF. The ad-hoc nature of BarCamp sessions allows<br />
discussions to flow freely and deepen with smaller groups throughout the<br />
day.</p>
<p>BarCampApache Sydney is hosted by the Information and Communications<br />
Technology centre at the University of Sydney, with additional support provided<br />
by sponsors Alfresco, Atlassian, IBM, and MaestroDev.</p>
