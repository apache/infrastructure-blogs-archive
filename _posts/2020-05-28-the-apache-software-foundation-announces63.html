<p><b><i>Mature Open Source Enterprise Cloud platform powers billions of dollars in transactions for the world's largest Cloud providers, Fortune 5 multinationals, educational institutions, and more.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Wakefield, MA &mdash;28 May 2020&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today Apache&reg; CloudStack&reg; 4.14, the latest version of the mature, turnkey enterprise Cloud orchestration platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache CloudStack is the proven, highly scalable IaaS platform of choice to rapidly and easily create private, public, and hybrid Cloud environments: it "just works". CloudStack originated at Cloud.com in 2010, which was acquired by Citrix in 2011. CloudStack was submitted to the Apache Incubator in 2012 and graduated as an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP) in March 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apache CloudStack includes the entire "stack" of features in an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration, Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, full and open native API, resource accounting, and a first-class user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">"v4.14 is an exciting release for Apache Cloudstack and is the result of many months of collaboration by our community," said Sven Vogel, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. "We are introducing a number of major new features that have been driven by demand by users and operators of CloudStack based IaaS environments. At the same time, we have kept to the project's ethos of having a tightly defined scope and being the platform of choice on which to layer other services."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Of particular note are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Cloudstack Kubernetes Service gives operators the ability to deliver CaaS or K8aaS style services with no change to underlying&nbsp; infrastructure or business process<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">VM Ingestion gives operators the ability to easily &ldquo;import&rdquo; existing VMware environments into Cloudstack<br><br></span></li>
<li>The new backup and recovery framework, allows operators to integrate with any backup platform, giving a seamless user experience from the Cloudstack UI/API<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">"Apache Cloudstack 4.14 ships with a Technical Preview of Cloudstack&rsquo;s new User Interface," added Vogel. "This presents a new, &lsquo;enterprise feel&rsquo; user experience and is earmarked to replace the current UI. We are encouraging all Cloudstack users to explore the Technical Preview and give feedback to the community. Thank you to all of the contributors across our community who have made this release possible."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">More than 200 new features, enhancements, and fixes include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">New modern UI (Project Primate, Technical preview)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Backup and Recovery framework</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Backup and Recovery provider for Veeam&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">VM ingestion</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">CloudStack Kubernetes Service</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">L2 network PVLAN enhancements&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">UEFI support</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">KVM rolling maintenance</span></li>
