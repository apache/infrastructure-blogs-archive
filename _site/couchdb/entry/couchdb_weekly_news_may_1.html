First, the idea was brought up to turn this document into a PMC charter, a document that sets out what the PMC values, their commitment to diversity, and their pledge to the project. The second idea was about how merit is being recognised and it was brought up to broaden this around the four areas community, project, documentation and code. &quot;This is what we value. This is what we will recognise. Our promise to the community.&quot; (Noah Slater) It was agreed on creating two documents, one for the PMC charter, a second one for diversity. Discussion: Project by-laws (ongoing discussion; see thread) Proposal to vote in set of project by-laws that define the specific roles in this community and the decision making procedures that are used. The first draft of the by-laws has been discussed and modified accordingly and can be found here. Comments are very welcome. Apache CouchDB Developer Code of Conduct (ongoing discussion; see thread) The PMC initiated a thread on moving forwards establishing an Apache CouchDB Developer Code of Conduct (CoC for short). Example Codes of Conduct from Debian, Python, Django , Bantik, Node.JS and the Node.JS IRC channel policy were as well considered and discussed as transparency, the consequences of infractions and the differentiation between minor offences and major offences, how to deal with profanity and how this applies to IRC and the moderation policy there. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) / HIPAA 5010 / PIPEDA compliance (see thread) Question on building applications using CouchDB while having to follow HIPAA compliance. As for the legal topic this is, the community strongly recommended the user get in touch with a lawyer and getting proper compliancy and regulatory guidance. CouchDB load spike (see thread, see also the same question on StackOverflow) Setup: CouchDB 1.5.0, database with &lt; 10 GB of data in it and continuous replication. Every few hours (3-4 times per day) they recognise a huge spike that floors the load to around 1.5 and memory usage to close to 100%. It turned out there was a similar issue that was already discussed (link to gist). The user filed issue COUCHDB-2231. Tips for general CouchDB monitoring and graphs drawing tools to check what&#39;s causing huge spikes (from Alexander Shorin, see this reply): Munin plugin for CouchDB monitoring &ndash; It doesn&rsquo;t handle system metrics for the CouchDB process yet, but that will be added soon; users should make sure they have a similar plugin for their monitoring system. Skyline, a detector for spikes and other anomalies Oculus, a metrics correlation tool that makes it very easy to compare multiple graphs for an anomaly period with it.

<h5>Apache CouchDB Diversity Statement (<a href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=[DISCUSS]+Apache+CouchDB+Diversity+Statement.#query:[DISCUSS]%20Apache%20CouchDB%20Diversity%20Statement.%20list%3Aorg.apache.couchdb.dev%20order%3Adate-backward+page:2+mid:fqfvc6ghp3ssk5ef+state:results">see thread</a>)</h5>
<p>This discussion was initiated with the suggestion to establish a project-wide Diversity Statement. First, the idea was brought up to turn this document into a PMC charter, a document that sets out what the PMC values, their commitment to diversity, and their pledge to the project. The second idea was about how merit is being recognised and it was brought up to broaden this around the four areas <em>community</em>, <em>project</em>, <em>documentation</em> and <em>code</em>. <strong>"This is what we value. This is what we will recognise. Our promise to the community."</strong> (Noah Slater) It was agreed on creating two documents, one for the PMC charter, a second one for diversity.</p>

<p>The PMC initiated a thread on moving forwards establishing an Apache CouchDB Developer Code of Conduct (CoC for short). Example Codes of Conduct from <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2014/vote_002">Debian</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Django</a> , <a href="https://github.com/bantik/contributor_covenant">Bantik</a>, <a href="http://nodeirc.info/">Node.JS</a> and the <a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling">Node.JS IRC channel policy</a> were as well considered and discussed as transparency, the consequences of infractions and the differentiation between minor offences and major offences, how to deal with profanity and how this applies to IRC and the moderation policy there.</p>

<p>Setup: CouchDB 1.5.0, database with < 10 GB of data in it and continuous replication. Every few hours (3-4 times per day) they recognise a huge spike that floors the load to around 1.5 and memory usage to close to 100%. It turned out there was a similar issue that was already discussed (<a href="https://gist.github.com/7601778">link to gist</a>).

<li>Note on a use case, written by Dave Cottlehuber (see <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6dtkpwt66f7c7755">email</a>): <strong>Creating databases for new users signing up with a CouchDB login.</strong> &ndash; A common pattern for CouchDB is to have a per-user database, because this is the only boundary where CouchDB enforces user permissions for security. It also makes replicating user data to another device very straightforwards. When you have a new user signing up with a CouchDB login, you&rsquo;ll often want to create a database for them immediately. While there&rsquo;s no built-in feature to do this for you, the CouchDB community have of course rolled their own like these:
