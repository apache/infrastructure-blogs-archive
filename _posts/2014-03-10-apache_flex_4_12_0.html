    4.12\r\n\r\nIs there a way to have a visual design in flex4.12 ? (complex layouts
    really are very hard to be done without this feature): is there an aletrnative

  content: Hi, I work as Flexer for commercial bank - now we use Flex, but there is
    a fear about the future of the Flash Player Runtime... Despite this there is no
    reasonable alternative to do what has been done and make it work as good as it
    works now. I want to note once again, that if stable version of FlexJS will be
    ever released (Flex 5 =) - it will be the "second breath" for Flex.

  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at the MaskedTextInput problem. I must say
    that very complex mask was not tested and only tried most common patterns (date,
    ccc, iban, phone...), so it's normal that now the component is out in official
    SDK experimental library we find troubles with some kind of complex patterns.
    As we see the problems we could improve the algorithm and support more use cases.
    I'll report what I see in flex dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nThanks for using it and
    reporting the problems found! :)"

    doing a great job, now flex is moving forward and faster.\r\n\r\nBy the way, why
    apache flex is not release on a public maven repository ? I know that you can
    mavenize your own SDK but will be amazing to have a public repository with all
    release, similar to other apache projects.\r\n\r\nThanks guys for all your work."

  content: "@Justin @WitchLake, I think I catch the problem: I test the sample proposed
    and you can enter restricted chars as expected and delete it in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem comes when you try to remove chars from (in example) between chars from
    a \"only numbers\" to a \"only alphanumeric\", since you \"drag\" chars to unalloyed
    positions (numbers in only alphanumeric).\r\n\r\nI think we must disscuss in the
    dev mailing list how to solve this situation.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nC."
