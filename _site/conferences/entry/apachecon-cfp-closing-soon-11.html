<meta name="description" content="Hello, fellow Apache enthusiast. Thanks for your participation, and interest in, the projects of the Apache Software Foundation. I wanted to remind you that the Call For Papers (CFP) for ApacheCon North America, and Apache: Big Data North America, closes in less than a month. If you&#39;ve been putting it off because there was lots of time left, it&#39;s time to dig for that inspiration and get those talk proposals in. It&#39;s also time to discuss with your developer and user community whether there&#39;s a track of talks that you might want to propose, so that you have more complete coverage of your project than a talk or two. We&#39;re looking for talks directly, and indirectly, related to projects at the Apache Software Foundation. These can be anything from in-depth technical discussions of the projects you work with, to talks about community, documentation, legal issues, marketing, and so on. We&#39;re also very interested in talks about projects and services built on top of Apache projects, and case studies of how you use Apache projects to solve real-world problems. We are particularly interested in presentations from Apache projects either in the Incubator, or recently graduated. ApacheCon is where people come to find out what technology they&#39;ll be using this time next year. Important URLs are: To submit a talk for Apache: Big Data - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america/program/cfp To submit a talk for ApacheCon - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/program/cfp To register for Apache: Big Data - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america/attend/register- To register for ApacheCon - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/attend/register- Early Bird registration rates end March 12th, but if you&#39;re a committer on an Apache project, you get the low committer rate, which is less than half of the early bird rate! For further updated about ApacheCon, follow us on Twitter, @ApacheCon, or drop by our IRC channel, #apachecon on the Freenode IRC network. Or contact me - rbowen@apache.org - with any questions or concerns. Thanks!" />
