<meta name="description" content="Your support helps The Apache Software Foundation &mdash;the world&#39;s largest Open Source foundation&mdash; to continue to provide $20B+ worth of software for the public good at 100% no cost. &lt;/p&gt; As the US Thanksgiving holidays are upon us, our end-of-year Individual Giving and Corporate Gifts campaigns have begun. Your support of The Apache Software Foundation helps ensure 350+ Apache projects and initiatives remain accessible to all, absolutely free of charge. Support from donors enables the all-volunteer, vendor-neutral ASF ensure its community-driven projects are freely available to billions of users, to steward, develop, and advance the next generation of Open Source innovations &quot;The Apache Way&quot;, and nuture diverse communities around the globe. This Tuesday, 3 December, is Giving Tuesday &mdash;the global fundraising movement that launched the second largest giving day of the year. When you donate to the ASF on Giving Tuesday itself, you can be a part of something even bigger: in 2018 more than $400M was raised for hundreds of organizations worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; Whether you donate on Giving Tuesday or as part of your year-end contributions, giving to the ASF is easy:&nbsp; Individual Donations &lt;/p&gt; One-Time or Monthly Recurring Donations: visit https://donate.apache.org/ to make a donation using a debit or credit card, ACH electronic transfer, or PayPal. You&#39;ll receive a receipt for your tax-deductible* contribution via email.

Additional Options: to mail us a check, donate cryptocurrency, or explore other contribution options, please visit http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html Corporate Gifts&lt;/p&gt; One-time or Recurring Donations: some organizations contribute to the ASF in the form of a cash donation --whether it&#39;s a one-time gift or recurring monthly made at https://donate.apache.org/ Those wishing to contribute cryptocurrency and other donation options are welcome to visit http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html for details. Corporate Sponsorship: those seeking to become a Sponsor using a credit card, ACH transfer, or PayPal may easily do so at https://donate.apache.org/ . We invite interested parties to review our Sponsorship program at http://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html Corporate Giving Programs: your gift to the ASF as part of an annual corporate giving program helps bolster the ASF&rsquo;s mission. Companies such as Bloomberg Philanthropies, IBM, Microsoft, and many others&#39; matching gift programs offer tax benefits, and provide their employees the ability to boost their support of a diverse set of nonprofit organizations. Contact us at fundraising(at)apache(dot)org to get started. Corporate Matching Gifts: if you have a matching gift program, your contribution to the ASF can be generously increased.

The ASF does not pay for code development or contributions by its Board of Directors, Executive Officers, 765 Individual ASF Members, 205 Apache Project Management Committees, 7,500+ Committers, and countless contributors.&nbsp; Your tax-deductible* contribution to the ASF helps offset day-to-day operating expenses that include critical Infrastructure services (75%), plus Marketing and Publicity, Trademarks and Brand Management, Legal Affairs, Accounting, Operational support, and more.
