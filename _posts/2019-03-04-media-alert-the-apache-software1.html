<div><strong>Wakefield, MA &mdash;4 March 2019&mdash;</strong> ApacheCon, the official conference series of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), announced today the Apache Roadshow/DC, held in partnership with George Mason University (GMU).</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>WHO</strong></div>
<div>The Apache Software Foundation is the world's largest Open Source foundation. The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates more than 350 enterprise-grade projects that serve as the backbone for some of the most visible and widely used applications in computing today. From artificial intelligence and deep learning, Big Data, build management, Cloud computing, content management, DevOps, IoT and Edge computing, mobile, servers, Web frameworks, and many other categories, all Apache software products are available to the public-at-large at 100% no cost, and benefit billions of users around the world.</div>
<div></div>
<div>George Mason University, Virginia&rsquo;s largest and most diverse public research university, enrolls 37,000 students from 130 countries and all 50 states, who attend on campuses in Fairfax, Arlington, Manassas, and Loudoun, Virginia, as well as in Songdo, South Korea.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Apache Roadshow is held in cooperation with the Center for Assurance Research &amp; Engineering (CARE) of the Volgenau School of Engineering at George Mason University. The multidisciplinary school maintains a dual pre-eminence in both information technology and engineering, and seeks to graduate students who will take initiative, step up, and leave the planet better than they found it.</div>
<div></div>

<div>Apache Roadshows are part of the official ASF conference series: they are smaller events with a more focused program and regional community engagement.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Topics include The Apache Way, analytics, Big Data, Cloud, cybersecurity, governance, healthcare, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), and security, featuring Apache projects such as Airflow, Cassandra, cTAKES, Daffodil (incubating), Drill, Fortress, Hadoop, Ignite, NiFi, Rya, Tomcat, and more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Speakers include representatives from The Apache Software Foundation, Apifocal, Benefits Data Trust, BMC Software, Capital One, Cloudera, ConSensys, DataNexus, Deloitte, Deutsche Bank, Fannie Mae, George Mason University, GridGain, IEEE, MITRE, Symas, Thomson Reuters, Total Child Health, Tresys, US Naval Academy, Verizon Media, and WSO2, among others.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The Roadshow's opening keynote, "Why Open Source is Vital in IT", will be presented by Jim Jagielski, co-founder of the ASF, Project Management Committee member of Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat, and Open Source Chef at ConSensys.</p>
