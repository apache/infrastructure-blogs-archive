<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News November 2017 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about our continuing work to convert Minilang to Groovy, we participate and collaborate during our Community Days, we share some community statistics about how we are working together and we celebrate our 11th year as an Apache Top Level project. Happy OFBiz Birthday! It was 11 years ago on 20th December 2006 that Apache OFBiz graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top Level Project. Since then, with the help of our great community, we have continued to grow, develop and incorporate new technologies. Our project now has 40 committers and includes a large number of contributors coming from our very active user and developer mailing lists. Over the past 11 years the project has released a range of OFBiz versions from 4.0 through to 16.11 and are currently preparing to create our branch releases that will be the basis for our next releases. Help us celebrate our Apache Birthday this month and we look forward to the next 11 years at Apache! Minilang to Groovy Conversion Some time ago we mentioned that we would be converting our minilang scripts to Groovy where it was more efficient to do so. Work is still progressing on this and you can follow progress on JIRA OFBIZ 9350 Deprecate Minilang Also one of our contributors, Nicolas Malin has updated our test tools suite to include Groovy tests. Details of implementation can be found in JIRA OFBIZ-9996. If you would like to help in the conversion effort then please send a message to our dev mailing list.. Community Days - November During the year we try to hold several community days where our community comes together and collaborates of fixing issues and bugs, test or help produce something that helps the project. In the past the Community day has been a particular day only but feedback from the community asked us to extend the time to include the days before and after the weekend. Our final set of Community Days for 2017 was planned during November running from Friday 17th - Tuesday 22nd and several community members decided to volunteer their time to work on some of our outstanding issues. Thanks very much to everyone who has worked to improve OFBiz and make it a better overall product for our users.

    <h2>Apache OFBiz News November 2017 </h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news.<br />
This month we have news about our continuing work to convert Minilang to Groovy,  we participate and collaborate during our Community Days, we share some community statistics about how we are working together and we celebrate our 11th year as an Apache Top Level project.<br />
<!--more--> </p>
<h2>Happy OFBiz Birthday!</h2>
<p>It was 11 years ago on 20th December 2006 that Apache OFBiz graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top Level Project. Since then, with the help of our great community, we have continued to grow, develop and incorporate new technologies. Our project now has 40 committers and includes a large number of contributors coming from our very active user and developer mailing lists.</p>
<p>Over the past 11 years the project has released a range of OFBiz versions from 4.0 through to 16.11 and are currently preparing to create our branch releases that will be the basis for our next releases. Help us celebrate our Apache Birthday this month and we look forward to the next 11 years at Apache! </p>
<h2>Minilang to Groovy Conversion</h2>
<p>Some time ago we mentioned that we would be converting our minilang scripts to Groovy where it was more efficient to do so. Work is still progressing on this and you can follow progress on <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-9350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  JIRA OFBIZ 9350 Deprecate Minilang</a></p>
<p>Also one of our contributors, Nicolas Malin has updated our test tools suite to include Groovy tests. Details of implementation can be found in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-9996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  JIRA OFBIZ-9996</a>. If you would like to help in the conversion effort then please send a message to our dev mailing list..</p>
<h2>Community Days - November</h2>
<p>During the year we try to hold several community days where our community comes together and collaborates of fixing issues and bugs, test or help produce something that helps the project. In the past the Community day has been a particular day only but feedback from the community asked us to extend the time to include the days before and after the weekend.</p>
<p>Our final set of Community Days for 2017 was planned during November running from Friday 17th - Tuesday 22nd and several community members decided to volunteer their time to work on some of our outstanding issues. Thanks very much to everyone who has worked to improve OFBiz and make it a better overall product for our users.</p>
<h2>OFBiz Community Statistics</h2>

<ul>
<li> 27 newcomers to the project that have contributed to helping us with our Jira issues, (15 arrived in September, 11 in October and 1 in November)</li>
