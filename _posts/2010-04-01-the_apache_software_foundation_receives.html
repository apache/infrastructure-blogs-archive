<p>Today, the Apache Software Foundation announced it has agreed to<br />
sell all IP and assets of the foundation to Oracle. The agreement is<br />
a $1.5 billion all cash deal. The ASF board agreed to the terms<br />
after vigorous discussions last evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"We never considered the possibility of selling the ASF," said Jim<br />
Jagielski, Chairman of the ASF, "but Oracle made us a simply fantastic<br />
offer. Larry himself flew out last week to meet with us to address<br />
our concerns."</p>
<p>
As part of the agreement, Oracle obtains even more of the crucial<br />
LAMP-stack software products.</p>
<p>"It was Oracle's admission that the Web is more than 'just' Java<br />
or databases that finalized the decision for us," said Justin Erenkrantz,<br />
Director and President of the ASF.</p>
<p>
2009 marked the 10th Anniversary of the ASF.</p>
<p>We will be communicating updates about the status of our projects and our license in the near future.&nbsp; As a community based organization, we want to ensure the best experience for our existing committers, contributors, and users, under our new arrangement.</p>
