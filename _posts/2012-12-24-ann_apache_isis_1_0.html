  content: Is a binary download available for this distribution?  I'm not running
    Maven and I don't need the sources up front.

  content: "Hi Bob,\r\nNo, the only binaries made available are through Maven.\r\n\r\nIn
    theory you could just download the JARs from the Maven central repo; go to search.maven.org
    and enter \"isis\".  However, even once you've downloaded Isis, you would then
    need to parse the pom.xml's in order to bring down Isis' transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nBut
    I strongly recommend you use Maven in the first event... you can use our archetype
    to get up and running very quickly.  Later on, you could always port the build
    scripts to some other build tool that supports transitive dependencies, eg Gradle
    or Apache Ivy.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\nDan\r\n\r\nPS: these sorts of queries are best routed
    through the isis users mailing list, see isis.apache.org/support.html.\r\n\r\n"
