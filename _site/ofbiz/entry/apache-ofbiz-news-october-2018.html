<p>Please note that a security vulnerability has been reported in OFBiz releases 16.11.01 to 16.11.04.

<h3>Missing Security and Cache Headers in CMS Events</h3>
<p>Currently, in OFBiz, while rendering the view through the controller request we set the important security headers like x-frame-options, strict-transport-security, x-content-type-options, X-XSS-Protection and Referrer-Policy etc. in the response object. In a similar line, we set the cache related headers like Expires, Last-Modified, Cache-Control, Pragma. But these security headers are missing in the pages rendered through CMS. These headers are very crucial for the security of the application as they help to prevent various security threats like cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, clickjacking etc. These security headers will now be available in the response object prepared through the CMS also.</p>
