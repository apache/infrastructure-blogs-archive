Meet David Jumani - a Software Engineer and a Committer to the Apache CloudStack Project. David studied Computer Science and Engineering, and after graduation, he worked at some of the biggest virtualization and networking companies (such as VMware, Cisco and General Electric) developing cloud and on-premise applications, such as an incident co-relation engine (from which relationships can be drawn from monitoring events).

Love sports, adventures and am ready to take up any challenge that comes my way. Enjoy deconstructing problems, automating tasks, optimizing solutions and making life just a bit better today than it was yesterday! &nbsp; Tell us your story in one Tweet. &quot;Hello World&quot;.
