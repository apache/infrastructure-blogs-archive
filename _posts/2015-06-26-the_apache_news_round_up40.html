  content: "Greetings:\r\n\r\nThe Apache Open Office suite is the best anywhere. We
    use it for our publications and have done for some time now.\r\n\r\nI would like
    to know if anyone has had a problem with Open Office 4.1.1 when used with OS 10
    Yosimite on an iMAC. In our case, OO will not save a document with a password.
    Also it will not open a doc.ument that has been saved with a password.\r\nOtherwise,
    everything is OK.\r\n\r\nLes."
