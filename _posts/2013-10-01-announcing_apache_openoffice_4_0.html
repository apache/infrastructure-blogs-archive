    least you guys could offer a repository yourself instead of just hosting RPM files

  content: "Congratulations boys! It's true that the version 4.0 had some bugs, and
    the performance was worse than in the former. That's why I had to uninstall it
    and reinstall 3.4.1, but I think you're doing a very good job, you're in the right
    way.\r\n\r\nI wish a brilliant future to our OpenOffice. Bye!"

  content: "I use MS Office since the first versions of Word and Exel.I did a second
    attempt to change into OpenOffice becaus the development direction of MS is simply
    not convincing to me. After short trial period I can say: OO Writer is a good
    replacement for Word, OO Calc not yet one for Excel. A lot of functions need either
    more mouse-clicks (eg background color, copying a selected content) or do work
    very differently (eg you do not allow copying contents to not simply connected
    cells).\r\nI hope very much for an improvement before MS drops the support for
    Office 2003 completely."

  content: Having used vesrion 3 and 4.0 it was a natural to upgrade to 4.0.1 but
    I noticed I got a message during the installation to advise that certain add-ons
    were being disabled.  One of these turns out to have been Norton toolbar on IE
    11.0.  The vault app which stores user ID and passwords for the various websites
    requiring you to sign in is extremely useful and I am finding it difficult now
    to login to these websites.. Are you planning a fix in the near future or do I
    have to uninstall and reinstall version 4.0 where it worked perfectly?

  content: Very happy with this update. Had to use LibreOffice due to some bugs and
    perfomance issues with 4.0. But LibreOffice maintainers changed some Calcs behaviour
    to match one from MS Excel (copy-past, area selection etc.), what was complitely
    out of what I used to and extremely annoyed me... Now I'm with OO again. Thank
    You guys!!!

  content: "I installed OpenOffice 4.0.1 today and haven't explored it fully. Apart
    from being a bit slow to start up and using incompatible formatting in exchanging
    clipboard  text with my old Eudora v5 mail client,  I had only one real complaint
    about the old version 3.4.1. \r\n\r\nThat complaint was of OO's refusal to read
    Microsoft Word .docx files that arrive by email bearing only the extension .doc.
    \ OK, I know that's Microsoft's fault  but standing on principle hurts every OpenOffice
    user who tears their hair as I do when they attempt to open such a file and get
    the message that it is corrupt. Perhaps some of us have not even twigged that
    such files are not corrupt, just named wrongly.\r\n\r\nSo gleefully I tried OO4
    thinking that by now surely somebody in the Apache camp had encountered this problem
    and simply fixed it by a patch examining the header of a file marked .doc to see
    if it should be .docx? Now alas we all know the answer... complete ignoral of
    the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen, oh when, will somebody FIX IT?\r\n"

<p>The Apache OpenOffice project (formerly OpenOffice.org) is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apache 4.0.1.&nbsp; Building upon the success of our <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/119867/bossie-awards-2013-the-best-open-source-desktop-and-mobile-software-226979#slide8">award-winning</a> Apache OpenOffice 4.0 release, which was well-received by both users and reviewers, the 4.0.1 maintenance update brings new translations, performance enhancements and bug fixes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can download OpenOffice 4.0.1 from our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>New translations introduced in this release are:&nbsp; Basque,&nbsp;<br />
 Khmer,<br />
 Lithuanian,</p>
<p> Polish,<br />
Serbian Cyrillic,<br />
  Swedish,<br />
     Traditional Chinese,<br />
Turkish and<br />
    Vietnamese. &nbsp; It is an important part of our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mission.html">Public Service Mission</a> to support, with help from our translation volunteers, minority and regional languages that are typically ignored by commercial vendors.&nbsp;&nbsp; We now ship OpenOffice in 32 languages.&nbsp; <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html">With your help</a> we could support many more.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This update also includes many bug fixes, including performance fixes.&nbsp; For example, one common scenario saving Microsoft Excel files was sped up 230%.&nbsp;&nbsp; A repaint issue reported by several 4.0.0 users was fixed.&nbsp; In general the most common issues reported by 4.0.0 users are fixed in this update.&nbsp; A full list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.0.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In parallel with work on 4.0.1 the project has also been working on 4.1.0 items.&nbsp; Although no date has been set for this release, areas of focus include:&nbsp; improved interoperability with Microsoft Office, integration of IAccesible2 accessibility support, and (of course) new translations and bug fixes.</p>
