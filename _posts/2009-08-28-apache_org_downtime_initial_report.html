<p>This is a short overview of what happened on Friday August 28 2009<br />
to the apache.org services.&nbsp; A more detailed post will come at a later<br />
time after we complete the audit of all machines involved.</p>
<p> On August 27th, starting at<br />
about 18:00 UTC an account used for automated backups for the ApacheCon<br />
website hosted on a 3rd party hosting provider was used to upload files<br />
to minotaur.apache.org.&nbsp; The account was accessed using SSH key<br />
authentication from this host.</p>
<p><b>To the best of our knowledge at this time, no end users were affected by this incident,&nbsp; and the attackers were not able to escalate their<br />
privileges on any machines.</b></p>
<p><b>While we have no evidence that downloads were affected, users are always advised to check digital<br />
signatures where provided.</b>
<p>minotaur.apache.org runs<br />
FreeBSD 7-STABLE and is more widely known as people.apache.org.&nbsp;<br />
Minotaur serves as the seed host for most apache.org websites, in<br />
addition to providing shell accounts for all Apache committers.</p>
<p>The<br />
attackers created several files in the directory containing files for<br />
www.apache.org, including several CGI scripts.&nbsp; These files were then<br />
rsynced to our production webservers by automated processes.&nbsp; At about<br />
07:00 on August 28 2009 the attackers accessed these CGI scripts over<br />
HTTP, which spawned processes on our production web services. </p>
<p>At about 07:45 UTC we noticed these rogue processes on eos.apache.org, the Solaris 10 machine that normally serves our websites.</p>
<p>Within the next 10 minutes we decided to shutdown all machines involved as a precaution.</p>
<p>After<br />
an initial investigation we changed DNS for most apache.org services to<br />
eris.apache.org, a machine not affected and provided a basic downtime<br />
message.</p>
<p>After investigation, we determined that our European fallover and backup machine, aurora.apache.org, was not affected.&nbsp;&nbsp; While<br />
the some files had been copied to the machine by automated rsync<br />
processes, none of them were executed on the host, and we restored from<br />
a ZFS snapshot to a version of all our websites before any accounts<br />
were compromised.</p>
<p>At this time several machines remain offline, but most user facing websites and services are now available.</p>
<p>We will provide more information as we can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
