<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m a big fan of NetBeans, and a team-lead of 2pm.tech crew, a group of independent developers from Russia. For about the last five years, we have been using NetBeans in all of our projects, from &quot;hardcore C embedded systems&quot; to &quot;Grails web-apps&quot;, and as a result we&#39;ve also been hacking NetBeans a little. As of 2018, there are now 11 developers in the team. Currently, half of us work with Grails apps, despite the poor Grails support in NetBeans at the moment. We&#39;re continuing to work with NetBeans due to it simplicity, small footprint, and design. If the NetBeans community would dig up the Groovy/Grails support, lots of developers will switch to NetBeans I think, and also I&#39;ll be very happy, too. :-) One of coolest things we&#39;ve created lately is the Crew Look &amp; Feel plugin, which we hadn&#39;t released to the public yet and now we think the time has come. It&#39;s not too complicated, but a nice little add-in to have, maybe it&#39;ll be useful for other users too. Here it is on the Plugin Portal: http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/74527/2pmtech-look-and-feel Click to enlarge the images below, to get a feel for the new plugin that provides our look and feel: &lt;/img&gt; &lt;/img&gt; NetBeans is my favorite IDE and Apache is one of my technological icons. So, I&#39;m very happy for NetBeans to be migrating to Apache. Apache does not always give you a sweet design, though it does always provide nice UNIX-like tools, and I love it. I hope Apache will make NetBeans not only better, but the best IDE for all Java-based technologies. :-)" />
