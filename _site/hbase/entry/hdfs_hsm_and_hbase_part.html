<meta name="description" content="This is part 1 of a 7 part report by HBase Contributor, Jingcheng Du and HDFS contributor, Wei Zhou (Jingcheng and Wei are both Software Engineers at Intel) &lt;/p&gt; Introduction Cluster Setup Tuning Experiment Experiment (continued) Issues Conclusions Introduction As more and more fast storage types (SSD, NVMe SSD, etc.) emerge, a methodology is necessary for better throughput and latency when using big data. However, these fast storage types are still expensive and are capacity limited. This study provides a guide for cluster setup with different storage media. &lt;/p&gt; In general, this guide considers the following questions: What is the maximum performance user can achieve by using fast storage? Where are the bottlenecks? How to achieve the best balance between performance and cost? How to predict what kind of performance a cluster can have with different storage combinations? In this study, we study the HBase write performance on different storage media. We leverage the hierarchy storage management support in HDFS to store different categories of HBase data on different media. &lt;/p&gt; Three different types of storage (HDD, SSD and RAMDISK) are evaluated. HDD is the most popular storage in current usages, SATA SSD is a faster storage which is more and more popular now. RAMDISK is used to emulate the extremely high performance PCI-e NVMe based SSDs and coming faster storage (e.g. Intel 3D XPoint&reg; based SSD). Due to hardware unavailability, we have to use RAMDISK to perform this emulation. And we believe our results hold for PCI-e SSD and other fast storage types. &lt;/p&gt; Note: RAMDISK is logical device emulated with memory. Files stored into RAMDISK will only be cached in memory. Methodology We test the write performance in HBase with a tiered storage in HDFS and compare the performance when storing different HBase data into different storages. YCSB (Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark, a widely used open source framework for evaluating the performance of data-serving systems) is used as the test workload. Eleven test cases are evaluated in this study. &nbsp;We split the table into 210 regions in 1 TB dataset cases to avoid region split at runtime, and we pre-split the table into 18 regions in 50 GB dataset cases.
