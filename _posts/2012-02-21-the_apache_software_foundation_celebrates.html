  content: "Reverse the trend, I don't know yet, or I'd doubt.\r\nIt will stop the
    (relative) bleeding though. (I don't like the word bleeding though)\r\n\r\nI will
    not preach for any http server, I'm agnostic at full extent... All have their
    perks and advantages, and at use, I'd say a wise move (today) is a tight mix of
    different daemons (not demons ;-) ). My general case today is simply placing an
    nginx in front of an Apache to take away alot of load without losing well learnt
    features, user-managed ,with Apache (that .htaccess for example).\r\nApache, imho,
    is by far a great http server when it comes to versatility, the vast range of
    functionality has been the source of it's biggest defect, it got a tad heavy,
    not by it's core alone, true, but some of the common modules (ok, mod_php/perl/whatever,
    or cgi-style, I could have lightened it up, but still) and it's natural overhead...
    where others, for atomic sized operations could spit out files in a blitz (and
    become a cheap forward proxy for bigger operations, those that represent <10/15%
    of the hits) ... Lighty, Nginx, name it, they deserve a crown of laurels just
    as well as Apache... They will remain complementary, and I wish they continue
    to co-exist, even if 2.4 seems lighter... I still see them work together (add
    some Varnish on top too :-) ) no competition, no fuss, no \"Mine is smaller (ram
    footprint) than yours\", just friend deamons, playing poker around a table, doing
    their best to make IIS lose and pay a pint of market share to the others!\r\n\r\nLess
    \"drunk\" note:\r\nThe reduced memory footprint is appealing, I'll test it, and
    might impatiently wait for it to get packaged (yeah, not alone on the machinery,
    so sticking to distros)"

    than our good ol' Apache), a lighter Apache can be no harm at all, au contraire..."

    is versatile, and is well understood for many non-techies... plus, most of the
    bloggers in the world know how to manage a .htaccess since some time, doing the
    same with Nginx can be a stiff learning curve for many. (This is why I host sites
    on an Apache behind an Nginx... If it was only my websites, I would have avoided
    it since a while)\r\n\r\npre 2.4 Apache is bloated, we have to admit it, so let's
    see how 2.4 turns out.\r\n\r\nBut my bottom thought is this: They are complementary,
    and non-exclusive... use both together and you get an intelligent mix between
    performance and comfort of use (especially when you host sites for others)"

<p><i><b>World's most popular Web Server powers nearly 400 million Websites across the globe</b></i></p>
<p>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 21 February 2012 &ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced version 2.4 of the award-winning Apache HTTP Server. Celebrating its 17th anniversary with an all-time record of nearly 400 million Websites powered worldwide[1], the Apache HTTP Server has been the most popular Web server on the Internet since April 1996.</p>
<p>"It is with great pleasure that we announce the availability of Apache HTTP Server 2.4", said Eric Covener, Vice President of the Apache HTTP Server Project. "This release delivers a host of evolutionary enhancements throughout the server that our users, administrators, and developers will welcome. We've added many new modules in this release, as well as broadened the capability and flexibility of existing features".</p>
<p>Numerous enhancements make Apache HTTP Server v2.4 ideally suited for Cloud environments. They include:<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved performance (lower resource utilization and better concurrency)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced memory usage<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asyncronous I/O support<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic reverse proxy configuration<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance on par, or better, than pure event-driven Web servers<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More granular timeout and rate/resource limiting capability<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More finely-tuned caching support, tailored for high traffic servers and proxies.</p>
<p>Additional features include easier problem analysis, improved configuration flexibility, more powerful authentication and authorization, and documentation overhaul. For the complete feature list, please see <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/new_features_2_4.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/new_features_2_4.html<br /></a><br />The Apache Web Server began as a fork (an independent development stream) of the NCSA httpd Web server created by Rob McCool at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). After McCool's departure from NCSA in 1994, an online community of individuals called the Apache Group formed to support and enhance its software via email collaboration. The Apache Group&rsquo;s founding members included Brian Behlendorf, Roy Fielding, Rob Hartill, David Robinson, Cliff Skolnick, Randy Terbush, Robert Thau, and Andrew Wilson.</p>
<p>Within less than a year of the Apache Group's formation, the Apache server surpassed NCSA httpd as the #1 server on the Internet &ndash;and remains so to this day. In March 1999, members of the Apache Group formed The Apache Software Foundation to provide organizational, legal, and financial support for the Apache HTTP Server.</p>
<p><b>Availability and Oversight</b><br />Apache HTTP Server software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.

<p><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</b><br />Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 350 individual Members and 3,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo.
