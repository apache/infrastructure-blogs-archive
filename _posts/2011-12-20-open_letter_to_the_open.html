    is the king. Oracle wants to control how you use your own software while libre
    office gives the user total control while preserving the essential freedoms of
    a users own system. If wont be too long now before you will give ownership of
    your pc to oracle corporation so they can plunder your data for their own ends.

  content: "You can put a fork in it.\r\n\r\nIt was done when Oracle killed it.\r\n\r\nPutting
    it under the \"less restrictive\" Apache license encourages developers to work
    on LibreOffice, which they've done.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice has accomplished more positive
    change since the fork than OpenOffice has done in the two years since... or after.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    Apache.  You were handed a steaming carcass.  Sure, it was warm.  But it's not
    good to eat.\r\n\r\nTime to stop the suckup status reports and face the reality.
    \ OpenOffice is done.  Put a fork in it.  \r\n\r\nE"

  content: "Ah, Anonymous, Anonymous.\r\n\r\nIt's quite a pity that you're choosing
    to forget that LibreOffice and TDF do predate the extremely ingenious offer that
    IBM and Oracle made to the Apache Foundation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to my question:
    when can we expect something similar to a release plan, and, perhaps, a working
    release?\r\n\r\nI do understand, that squeezing the OpenOffice codebase into subversion
    is not making the whole process developer-friendly (more probably, it makes everything
    actively developer-hostile), but surely, with all of the Apache Foundation backing
    there should be a way to get something half-working out."

    \"team@openoffice.org\" account.  If ASF thinks that's illegitimate, don't they
    have control of the domain and thus the ability to wrest control of the PayPal
    account?\r\n\r\n(I hope I haven't just given someone a good idea.)"

  content: "When Oracle handed Sun's code to the Apache Foundation * I * knew right
    then it was a steaming pile of ordure, ready to rot where it lay and permissive
    Apache's licensing as opposed to Libre Office's would kill it eventually. Why
    would open source developers code for a product that can be taken private and
    proprietary thus stealing the work of all those many volunteers? I switched the
    day the first iteration of Libre Office came out. \r\n\r\nPersonally I hope that
    OOo does the right thing and hands all the code, IP, trademarks and so forth over
    to Libre Office, but I've heard it said that you can hope in one hand and 'spit'
    in the other and notice which one fills up first."

  content: "The Document Foundation chooses part development by themselves, no one
    forces them to. If they want to have another project they are free to do that
    under another logo.\r\n\r\nThe Document Foundation is not the \"primary development
    collaboration\" as it doesn't provide most of the patches. Just look at the http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/08/01/libreoffice-3-4-2-for-enterprise-users/\r\n\r\nThe
    last one is also an answer to \"By now most of the OpenOffice.org developers are
    working on LibreOffice project.\" The sentence isn't false but totally misses
    that many patches end up commited to both office suites.\r\n\r\nOpenOffice has
    many forks with some of them being free projects and others provide some extra
    functionality for a price. Try perusing wikipedia before you post."

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Earlier this year the OpenOffice.org code base was donated to The Apache Software Foundation. The resulting project, Apache OpenOffice (Incubating) is progressing well as a podling in the Apache Incubator with a rapidly growing community and project infrastructure (see <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openofficeorg.html">http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openofficeorg.html</a>). This open letter seeks to articulate our vision for the future of Apache OpenOffice within the wider Open Document Format ecosystem.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">With the OpenOffice.org donation, Apache has become a significant part of a global ecosystem that was initially formed more than ten years ago, it includes support for an internationally recognised Open Standard for documents (the Open Document Format developed by the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications [OpenDocument] Technical Committee) and at least 13 related open source projects. In addition to being a critical component of the IT industry OpenOffice.org is of significant value to the global user community with approximately 100 million users and over 70 native language packs.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">In such a large ecosystem it is impossible to agree upon a single vision for all participants, Apache OpenOffice does not seek to define a single vision, nor does it seek to be the only player. Instead we seek to offer a neutral and powerful collaboration opportunity.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">The permissive <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a> reduces restrictions on the use and distribution of our code and thus facilitates a diverse contributor and user base for the benefit of the whole Open Document Format ecosystem. Within an Apache project it is possible to rise above political, social and commercial differences in the pursuit of maximally effective implementations of freely available open standards and related software tools.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Our license and open development model is widely recognised as one of the best ways to ensure open standards, such as ODF, gain traction and adoption. Apache OpenOffice offers much more potential for OpenOffice.org than "just" an end-user Microsoft Office replacement. We offer a vendor neutral space in which to collaborate whilst enabling third parties to pursue almost any for-profit or not-for-profit business model.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Apache has over 100 world leading projects and over 50 incubating projects. Within these projects we have demonstrated many times over that our model of collaboration is highly successful. Maximum benefit is gained through increased engagement with our communities. While it is possible, and legal, to take our code and work independently of the foundation we believe that collaborating wherever possible strengthens the ecosystem and facilitates progress towards one&rsquo;s own vision for ODF.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Each participant in an Apache project is free to set their own boundaries of collaboration. However, they are not free to use our trademarks in confusing ways. This includes OpenOffice.org and all related marks. To ensure that the use of Apache marks will not lead to confusion about our projects, we must control their use in association with software and related services provided by others. Our trademark policy is clearly laid out at <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/">http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/</a>.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Only the Apache Software Foundation can make releases of software that bear our trademarks. The Apache OpenOffice (Incubating) project has tentatively identified the first quarter of 2012 for a Version 3.4 release.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">As well as clarifying our position in relation to our trademarks we wish to make it clear that no third party has been given approval to solicit donations of any kind on behalf of the Apache Software Foundation or any of its projects, including OpenOffice.org.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">In general, if a communication does not come to you from a verifiable apache.org address then it is not an official Apache Software Foundation or OpenOffice.org communication.</font></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class=" "><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">We invite and encourage everyone engaged with the Open Document Format standards to explore opportunities for collaboration with the Apache OpenOffice (Incubating) project. For further information see <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/get-involved.html"><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/get-involved.html">http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/get-involved.html</a></a></font></font><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/get-involved.html"> </a>.</p>
