    does not allow to load plugins, list is almost empty.\r\nCould you please clarify
    situation with plugins?"

  content: 'Apache NetBeans is only focused on Java SE. For all other features, you
    can use the 8.2 Update Center, at your own risk, and after registering it yourself,
    using the URL for that from 8.2. However, these features, though in most cases
    usable, have not been tested with Apache NetBeans and are not part of the release. '

    telemetry and Objects(all classes) but not for Methods: EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
    then crash.\r\n\r\nPlease advise."

  content: "..um, pardon, but what?\r\nI mean, while NetBeans is an excellent IDE
    to learn and develop in Java, now literally every second bush releases their Java
    IDE, even for free.\r\n\r\nDoes the above mean that there are even licensing issues
    with e.g. NetBeans PHP and all the others?\r\nIf not, at least a non-Oracle mirror
    of the \"historical\" plugins would be essential.\r\n\r\nThat aside, in general,
    we - users who try to cope simultaneously with the unparalleled evolution of hipster
    technologies, some of which we use or would use, *and* the current issues NetBeans
    are going through - could use some more transparency.\r\n\r\nAt a very basic level,
    I think what you proclaimed here should be headlines on the incubation page, and
    not an obscure comment with a 12 pixel font size under a blog page."

<p>We're currently running two processes, both of which it would be great if everyone would participate in -- and in fact it's really important that everyone does these two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vote in the PPMC thread:
<p><a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a644bb8e3ba2cbd06328bb004f1b18b4171763cd3d78a9131615f687@%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E">https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a644bb8e3ba2cbd06328bb004f1b18b4171763cd3d78a9131615f687@%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E</a></p>
<p>Doing the above means more than putting a +1, it means downloading the sources, building them, looking at keys, etc, as described above.</p>
</li>
<li>Fill out the Community Acceptance survey, which is focused on the functionality (versus the sources, which is what the PPMC thread is about), which takes about 5 minutes:
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw1WT1HDjR-nPMcXn8gBCQXk5k3IiXSoXW85FZezaPQQzGTQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw1WT1HDjR-nPMcXn8gBCQXk5k3IiXSoXW85FZezaPQQzGTQ/viewform<br />
</a></p>
<p>The Community Acceptance Survey runs until Sunday the 22nd of July. Issues found in the meantime will hopefully not be critical and not require a new voting candidate, but we'll need to see how things go and nothing can be guaranteed here of course -- i.e., someone could find a blocker of some kind during the community acceptance survey process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, nothing going wrong and everything going well, we'll then be at a point to start the IPMC vote thread on the 23rd and, if everything goes well, release Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>After that we'll work on the 2nd donation, relicensing it, moving it into master etc.</p>
