    went all out and had a cake nearly as large as the one we had at ApacheCon Europe
    2009 - plus some great presentations, and even Contributor buttons.\r\n\r\nThose
    Contributor buttons and other licensed ASF merchandise are available from a handful
    of vendors on our Buy Stuff page, where a portion of all proceeds are donated
    to the ASF:\r\n\r\n\r\n  http://apache.org/foundation/buy_stuff.html\r\n\r\n\r\nShane's
    ASFSwag shop is where to find the buttons themselves:\r\n\r\n   http://asfswag.com/\r\n"

<p>As<br />
you know, the ASF turned 10 this year &mdash; our celebrations <a title="ASF 10th Anniversary Cake - ApacheCon Europe" href="../../foundation/date/200903">kicked off<br />
with cake at ApacheCon Europe</a> this past March. We were thrilled to<br />
receive birthday wishes from so many members from the Apache community<br />
from across the world.</p>
<p>Our festivities will continue at<br />
ApacheCon US (Oakland, California), where we will be holding the Big<br />
Feather Birthday Bash and related community events during the<br />
conference. We anticipate seeing many of you there!</p>
<p>Some of you<br />
are unable to join us in person, but we don't want you to miss out on<br />
the fun. As such, we're inviting our global community to "Raise a Glass<br />
to Apache" and celebrate this landmark event at your own local<br />
gathering. Recognizing Apache developers and users as part of the ASF's<br />
10th Anniversary is very important to us. We want you to join the fun,<br />
meet other Apache enthusiasts, make new friends, put faces to the names<br />
behind those emails, and, of course, engage in all things Apache.</p>
<p>We<br />
understand that communities have their own local culture and<br />
preferences: you are welcome to host the type of event best suited to<br />
your needs. Preferably, this will take place during the week of<br />
ApacheCon (2-6 November, 2009; the Big Feather Birthday Bash is on<br />
Wednesday, 4 November) &mdash;&nbsp; your event can be held on any day of that<br />
week, at any time of the day or night that is most convenient for you.<br />
Events include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Social Gatherings</b></i> &ndash; getting together over coffee, lunch, drinks, or dinner</li>
<li><i><b>Tech Talks</b></i> &ndash; individual or industry presentations given about ASF projects and actvities</li>
<li><i><b>Product Demos</b></i> &ndash; showcasing how Apache technologies are powering creative and robust solutions</li>
<li><i><b>Hackathon</b></i> &ndash; collaborating on Apache code bases with ASF Committers</li>
<li><i><b>MeetUps or GetTogethers</b></i> &ndash; featuring talks or presentations on a specific Apache Project or activity</li>
<li>
<i><b>Networking and Job Match</b></i> &ndash; connecting developers with users, employers<br />
with potential hires, clients with contractors/consultants, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can't<br />
wait until ApacheCon? That's OK: we're always up for a celebration, so<br />
feel free to get started as soon as you'd like &mdash; you can Raise a Glass<br />
to Apache at an upcoming conference such as the OpenWorld Forum<br />
(Paris), SpringOne 2GX (New Orleans), CPOSC 2009 (Harrisburg, PA),<br />
FOSS4G 2009 (Sydney), NLUUG Open Web (Amsterdam), UTOSC 2009 (Sandy,<br />
UT), and OSMC 2009 (N&uuml;rnberg), among others.</p>
<p>So let's get started! There are three steps to make your event happen:</p>
<p><u><b>Step<br />
1: Organize</b></u>. Decide who will be the host(s)/main point(s) of contact,<br />
where the event will be held, the day and time, the format, and any<br />
costs.</p>
<p><u><b>Step 2: Publicize</b></u>. Spread the word to your coworkers, the<br />
press, and your friends. Post details on your event on blogs, mailing<br />
lists, event listings, etc. Drive enthusiasm by discussing the event<br />
details to the media and on podcasts. Ask people who will be there to<br />
invite other groups who may be interested.</p>
<p><u><b>Step 3: Apprise</b></u>.<br />
Share your goodwill with the Apache community. Wish the ASF a happy<br />
anniversary on the Foundation blog;&nbsp; post photos of your event online;<br />
and submit a "MyApache" video tribute (can be one or more of the<br />
following -- 1-2 minutes describing why you love Apache; 1-2 minutes of<br />
your group Raising a Glass to Apache/singing Happy Birthday; 2-5<br />
minutes describing the cool ways you use ASF technologies ... be sure<br />
to mention which Apache projects you use as well as your results.)</p>
<p>The important thing is to have fun! Get inspired by checking out the <a title="ASF YouTube channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheApacheFoundation">ASF's YouTube channel</a>.<br />
"MyApache" submissions received by 2 October (midnight US Pacific<br />
time/GMT-8) will receive priority consideration to be featured in the<br />
ASF's ApacheWay channel and at the Big Feather Birthday Bash!</p>
<p>A<br />
schedule of all confirmed events will be posted on the ApacheCon site.<br />
To be included in the list, please send a copy of your invitation<br />
(including the date, time, and location) to <a ymailto="mailto:sk@apache.org" href="mailto:sk@apache.org">sk@apache.org</a>.<br />
I will send you information on how to add your event in the ApacheCon<br />
network, how to submit your "MyApache" tributes, as well as suggestions<br />
on how to organize and publicize your event.</p>
<p>Feel free to drop us a note with any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
