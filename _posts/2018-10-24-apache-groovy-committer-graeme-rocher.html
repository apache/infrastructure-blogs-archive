<p>
The <a href="http://groovy.apache.org/">Apache Groovy</a> team congratulates long-time Groovy committer Graeme Rocher on receiving his Groundbreaker award at Oracle Code One.<br />
Graeme has made numerous significant contributions to Apache Groovy and has also founded two of the most important frameworks using Groovy: <a href="https://grails.org/">Grails</a> and <a href="http://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a>. </p>

<p>"<em>Grails pioneered truly rapid web application development on the JVM, helping to drive the adoption of the Groovy language which today has such an inclusive community and phenomemal ecosystem</em>".&nbsp;</p>
