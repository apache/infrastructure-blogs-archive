<meta name="description" content="We&rsquo;re excited to announce the next Apache CouchDB Conf will be in Vancouver, Canada on November 13, 2013. Big thanks to Cloudant to helping to make this happen! Sign up to get notified when CouchDB Conf tickets go on sale. We&rsquo;re building the schedule with talks from all corners of the CouchDB community and hope to see you there this fall. This is a follow-up to our CouchDB Conf in Berlin, where we laid the groundwork for the BigCouch merge and other exciting features you&#39;ll hear about in Vancouver (geospatial data and PouchDB for mobile devices to name two). We&rsquo;ll be in Vancouver, BC the day before CascadiaJS 2013, which will be held November 14-15. Sign up to get notified when the next batch of CascadiaJS tickets go on sale. The Early Bird tickets sold out in 20 minutes! There&#39;s lots of crossover between the JavaScript and CouchDB communities. Data-driven web apps and CouchDB makes it a natural fit. So we hope you&#39;ll be able to stick around and experience what both conferences have to offer. We&rsquo;ll plan to keep running these Apache CouchDB Confs. Got suggestions? Feedback? Wanna help us with our next one? Get in touch publicly, or privately. You can also tweet us at @CouchDB. Whatever suits!" />
