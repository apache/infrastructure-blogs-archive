<p><b>Wilmington, DE &mdash;4 May 2021&mdash;&nbsp;</b><br></p>
<p><b><br>Who:</b> Apache OpenOffice, an Open Source office-document productivity suite comprising six productivity applications: Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, and Base. The OpenOffice suite is based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF), supports 41 languages, and ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, and Linux 32-bit. Apache OpenOffice delivers up to 2.4 Million downloads each month.<br><br></p>
<p><b>What:</b> A recently reported vulnerability states that all versions of OpenOffice through 4.1.9 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks, and could lead to untrusted code execution.&nbsp;<br><br>The Apache OpenOffice Project has filed a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures report with MITRE Corporation&rsquo;s national vulnerability reporting system:<br></p>
<p>> CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks<br>><br>> Severity: moderate<br>><br>>Credit: Fabian Br&auml;unlein and Lukas Euler of Positive Security https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce#open-libreoffice</p>
<p><br>The complete CVE report is available at <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2021-30245.html" target="_blank">https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2021-30245.html</a><br><br></p>
<p><b>How:</b> Applications of the OpenOffice suite handle non-http(s) hyperlinks in an insecure way, allowing for 1-click code execution on Windows and Xubuntu systems via malicious executable files hosted on Internet-accessible file shares.<br><br></p>
<p><b>Why:</b> The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10 assures that a security warning is displayed to give users the option of continuing to open the hyperlink. Best practice dictates to be careful when opening documents from unknown and unverified sources.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p><b>When:</b> The vulnerability predates OpenOffice entering the Apache Incubator. During the analysis of this issue, it was discovered that an incorrect bug fix was made by the StarOffice/OpenOffice.org developers preparing OpenOffice 2.0 in 2005, whilst under the auspices of Sun Microsystems.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p><br><b>Where:</b> Download Apache OpenOffice v4.1.10 at <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" target="_blank">https://www.openoffice.org/download/</a><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" target="_blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></a><br><br></p>
<p><b>Apache OpenOffice Highlights</b></p>
<p>24 October 2020 &mdash; 300 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice<br>14 October 2020 &mdash; 20 year anniversary of OpenOffice<br>18 October 2016 &mdash; 200 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice<br>17 April 2014 &mdash; 100 million downloads of Apache OpenOffice<br>17 October 2012 &mdash; OpenOffice graduated as an Apache Top Level Project (TLP)<br>13 June 2011 &mdash; OpenOffice.org entered the Apache Incubator</p>
