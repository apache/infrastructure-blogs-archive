<p>
Recent reports on various blogs have attributed to the ASF a number of<br />
the source files identified by Oracle as ones that they believe<br />
infringe on their copyrights.  The code in question has an header that<br />
mentions Apache, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  The<br />
code itself is using a license that is named after our foundation, is<br />
in fact the license that we ourselves use.  Many others use it too, as<br />
the license was explicitly designed to allow such uses.</p>
<p>
Even though the code in question has an Apache license, it is not part of<br />
Harmony. PolicyNodeImpl.java is simply not a Harmony class.</p>
<p>Verifying that something is from the Apache Software Foundation is<br />
very easy to do: our sources are all posted online. So it is<br />
sad when people don't take that step.</p></p>
