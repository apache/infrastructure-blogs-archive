<p>This is an April Fool's post: it is a humorous work and it does not describe actual developments.</p>
<p>As we on the Apache OpenOffice project put the final touches on our 4.1 release, we've started planning for our next major release, version 4.2, hopefully out sometime mid-year. One of the exciting new features we're looking forward to is support for the <b>OpenCash Protocol</b>, the new open standard for on-demand funding and delivery of both traditional currencies as well as the new cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>For several years it has been possible, with expensive proprietary systems, to do convenient on-demand funding and printing of postage stamps.&nbsp; The OpenCash protocol advances this to the next level, extended to currencies, and in an way that makes it accessible to users on all platforms. </p>
<p>We're still early in the design phase for this feature, but the gist of it can be seen in the following UI prototype: </p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/b3c382d4-cf7d-4efd-8097-718f4c82e03e" /></div>
<p> The basic flow would be: </p>
<ol>
<li>User selects desired currency, denomination and number of copies.</li>
<li>User specifies a funding source.</li>
<li>User confirms the desired settings, via the integrated print-preview, and prints the currency.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>No special hardware is required for traditional currencies, beyond a typical color inkjet or laser printer.&nbsp; Additionally, if the user has a 3D printer then they can "print" Bitcoins, just like you see in the news.</p>
<p>By embedding OpenCash into Apache OpenOffice, the leading open source office productivity suite, we do more than just increase convenience by reducing trips to the ATM.&nbsp; Since OpenCash permits pluggable funding sources, the integration into OpenOffice enables new models in areas like micro-finance and even fiscal stimulus.&nbsp; The possibilities are limited only by your imagination!</p>
