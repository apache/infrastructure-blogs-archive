<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">We are pleased to announce the release of "Trillions and Trillions Served", the documentary feature on The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the world&rsquo;s largest Open Source foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">"'Trillions and Trillions Served' celebrates the diverse experiences from members of the Apache community from around the world," said Sally Khudairi, ASF Vice President Marketing &amp; Publicity and Producer of "Trillions and Trillions Served". "The project is tribute to the innovation and passion that celebrates the ASF's incredible rise over the past 20 years. Watching our projects and their communities expand and thrive over the years has been exhilarating&nbsp;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-1e16df83-7fff-9386-804e-db84a5934946"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&mdash;</span></span><span style="font-size: 14px;">what a privilege to share our story with the world!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Advancing its mission of providing software for the public good, the ASF's all-volunteer community grew from 21 original Members overseeing the development of the Apache HTTP Server to 813 individual Members, 206 Apache Project Management Committees, and 7,800+ Committers shepherding 300 projects and 200M+ lines of Apache code valued at more than $20B. Apache's breakthrough technology touches every aspect of modern computing, powering most of the Internet, managing exabytes of data, executing teraflops of operations, and storing trillions of objects in virtually every industry. Apache projects are all freely-available, at 100% no cost, and with no licensing fees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The documentary was shot by Wyona Pictures on location in September and October 2019 at ApacheCon North America in Las Vegas and ApacheCon Europe in Berlin.</span></p>
