<div>The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis v1.13.1</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is primarily a bug fix release, with several new features/improvements, including:</div>
<div></div>
<div>* ISIS-1510 - Improve support for docker containers by allowing isis configuration properties to be overridden using either system properties or an ISIS_OPT environment variable</div>
<div>* ISIS-1499 - Improve BookmarkService to be able to "lookup" domain services, so that can schedule background commands against a service.</div>
<div>* ISIS-1508 - The integration test framework should be more resilient to badly behaved tests that leave the transaction incomplete</div>
<div></div>
<div>Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2], or download the release and build it from</div>
<div>source [3].</div>
<div></div>
<div>Enjoy!</div>
