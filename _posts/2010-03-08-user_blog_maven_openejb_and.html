<p>Magnus K Karlsson has written a nice blog post about using <a href="http://magnus-k-karlsson.blogspot.com/2010/02/getting-started-with-jboss-web-serivce.html">Maven, OpenEJB and eviware soapUI</a> to develop and test JAX-WS Web Services.</p>
<p>The full chain involves creating the Maven, OpenEJB driven unit tests and eventually deployment into JBoss with further testing driven manually via the eviware soapUI tool.</p>
