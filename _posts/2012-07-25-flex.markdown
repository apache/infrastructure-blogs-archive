The Apache Flex community is pleased to announce the release of Apache Flex
4.8.0-incubating!
 
Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash
Platform-based applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

This is the first release under the Incubator of the Apache Software
Foundation and represents the initial donation of Adobe Flex 4.6 by Adobe
System Inc.  Note that because Apache Flex is under "incubation", Apache
Flex is not an official Apache Project, and this is not an official Apache
release.  For more information see the DISCLAIMER file in the release.
 
This release marks the start of a new era for Flex.  The future of Flex is
now driven by the community instead of a corporation.  Users can have
important bugs fixed or new features added by contributing the code
themselves.
 
Apache Flex is available in source form from the following download page:

     http://incubator.apache.org/flex/download.html
 
 
When downloading from a mirror site, please remember to verify the downloads
using signatures found on the Apache site:
 
     http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/flex/KEYS
  
Apache Flex release packages are different from Adobe release packages.  For
information on how to use Apache Flex with existing IDEs, see:

     http://incubator.apache.org/flex/packager.html

Thank you for using Apache Flex,
The Apache Flex Community.
