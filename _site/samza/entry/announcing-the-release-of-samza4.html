<meta name="description" content="NOTE: We may introduce backward incompatible changes regarding samza job submission in the future 1.5 release. Details can be found on SEP-23: Simplify Job Runner We are thrilled to announce the release of Apache Samza 1.4.0. Today, Samza forms the backbone of hundreds of real-time production applications across a multitude of companies, such as LinkedIn, Slack, and Redfin, among many others. Samza provides leading support for large-scale stateful stream processing with: First class support for local state (with RocksDB store). This allows a stateful application to scale up to 1.1 Million events/sec on a single machine with SSD. Support for incremental checkpointing of state instead of full snapshots. This enables Samza to scale to applications with very large state. A fully asynchronous programming model that makes parallelizing remote calls efficient and effortless. High level API for expressing complex stream processing pipelines in a few lines of code. Beam Samza Runner that marries Beam&rsquo;s best in class support for EventTime based windowed processing and sophisticated triggering with Samza&rsquo;s stable and scalable stateful processing model. A fully pluggable model for input sources (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB streams etc.) and output systems (HDFS, Kafka, ElastiCache etc.). A Table API that provides a common abstraction for accessing remote or local databases and allowing developers are able to &ldquo;join&rdquo; an input event stream with such a Table. Flexible deployment model for running the applications in any hosting environment and with cluster managers other than YARN.
