<p>Most users are able to download, install and use Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org, now undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at Apache) using only freely available assistance: help files, <a href="http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation">online documentation</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a> or our volunteer-led <a href="http://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/">community support forums</a>.&nbsp; But in some cases, with larger, customized deployments, migrations, more complex requirements, etc., users and companies using OpenOffice might need some extra help, some professional expertise to help them get where they want to go.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is where the larger OpenOffice ecosystem comes in, with professional services of all kinds, offering training and certification, deployment and migration services, and various levels of customization and development services. </p>
<p>The legacy OpenOffice.org project hosted a list of individuals and companies offering OpenOffice-related services.&nbsp; But this directory was not well-maintained and had many dead links and outdated information.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we've decided to start from scratch with a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bizdev/consultants.html">new directory</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the new directory comes a new invitation to submit your information for inclusion.&nbsp; We're looking for professional services directly relevant to Apache OpenOffice and our users. &nbsp; If you want to submit a listing, please see <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bizdev/consultant-submission.html">these instructions</a> for the specific criteria and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have questions, please direct them to our <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/mailing-lists.html#development-mailing-list">ooo-dev mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Note: At Apache we never pay for development, and we do not recommend or endorse specific consultants.&nbsp;<br />
 But we are offering this directory as service to users and the broader<br />
ecosystem.</p>
