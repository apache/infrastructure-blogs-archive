    <h2>Apache OFBiz News&nbsp;September&nbsp;2019</h2>
<p>Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about new PMC Member joining along with our usual list of features, improvements, and Statistics.</p>
<h2>New PMC Member</h2>
<p>The OFBiz PMC has invited Pranay Pandey to become a new member of the committee and we are glad to announce that he has accepted the nomination.<br />
Please join us in welcoming and congratulating Pranay in his new role on the project, and also thanking him for all his contributions.</p>
<h2>Best of both Groovy worlds: compile and on the fly</h2>
<p>The community discussed how OFBiz users can have benefits of using Groovy with compilation as well as on the fly. Mathieu proposed to move Groovy scripts to/src/main/groovy/ and after adding the necessary package names, a developer can have continuously built on any changes in Gradle source sets with "gradlew --continuous" command. Besides compilation, it will enhance the integration in your IDE, and add the possibility to re-use methods from<br>these script migrated to explicit classes.<br>Thank you Jacques for initiating the thread, Mathieu for the initial proposal on OFBIZ-10226 and to everyone who contributed to this productive discussion. </p>
