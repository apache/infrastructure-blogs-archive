    Hi all. Today, we will briefly show you about PHP7.3 support which will be available in the <b>next NetBeans version</b> i.e. <b>NetBeans 10</b>.</p>
<p>
    First of all, I strongly hope that new features are tested by PHP users before NetBeans 10 is released because there should be bugs.<br />
    Definitely, need your help!<br />
    If you are interested in them, just test them. You can download a dev version <a href="https://builds.apache.org/job/incubator-netbeans-linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>PHP 7.3 Support</h3>
<p>
    To enable it, you have to set PHP 7.3 as the PHP version of your PHP project.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/caa46cc9-4573-4cc7-b16c-33facd7f3359"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/caa46cc9-4573-4cc7-b16c-33facd7f3359" alt="Nb10-php7.3-support-project-properties.png"></img></a></p>
<p>
    NetBeans provides support for the new three syntaxes.</p>
<h4>Allow a trailing comma in function calls</h4>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/9d09346e-e083-4384-9ab4-eb30cfb2fc28"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/9d09346e-e083-4384-9ab4-eb30cfb2fc28" alt="Nb10-php73-trailing-comma-in-function-calls.png"></img></a></p>
<h4>list() Referenct Assignment</h4>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/cd35d9af-901c-4d4b-8df5-f8115e682cd5"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/cd35d9af-901c-4d4b-8df5-f8115e682cd5" alt="Nb10-php73-list-reference-assignment.png"></img></a></p>
<h4>Flexible Heredoc and Nowdoc Syntaxes</h4>
<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/ea1ba304-5aca-4775-af78-baaec9481715"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/mediaresource/ea1ba304-5aca-4775-af78-baaec9481715" alt="Nb10-php73-flexible-heredoc-and-nowdoc-syntaxes.png"></img></a></p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> We won't provide support for the old syntax any longer.<br />
    i.e. NetBeans treats the following code as an error.</p>
<pre>
$heredoc = <<< END
END{$variable}
END;
</pre>
<h3>PHP 7.1, 7.2 and more PHP features</h3>
<p>
    The other PHP features for NetBeans 10 are <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Feature%3A+PHP">here</a>.<br />
    We have also implemented PHP7.1, 7.2, new hints, new code foldings and more.</p>
<p>
    That's all for today. As always, please test it. You can download a development version from<br />
    <a href="https://builds.apache.org/job/incubator-netbeans-linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/">Jenkins Build</a>.<br />
    If you find some issues or enhancements, please report them to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NETBEANS/issues">JIRA</a> with your exact steps to reproduce them.<br />
