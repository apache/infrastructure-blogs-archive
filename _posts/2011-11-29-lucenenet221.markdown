<p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;">We finally got it out the door, it took a lot longer than we expected. However, we have a ton of bug fixes rolled into this relase as well as a number of new features.</p> 
  <ul style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;"> 
    <li>Some of the bug fixes include: concurrency issues, mono compilation issues, and memory leaks.</li> 
    <li>A lot of work has been done to clean up the code base, refactoring the code and project files, and providing build scripts</li> 
    <li>A couple of new features: Search.Regex, Simple Faceted Search, and simple phrase analysis in the Fast Vector Highlighter</li> 
    <li>Download it now on our <a href="http://lucenenet.apache.org/download.cgi">downloads page</a></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12px;">Just around the corner is a 2.9.4g release (early January), that has been substantially refactored and uses generics across the board.</p>
