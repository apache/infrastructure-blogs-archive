<i>Celebrating a Decade of Open Source Leadership</i></p>
<p>
Exactly ten years ago, Roy Fielding signed the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html">Certificate of Incorporation</a> of <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation">The Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>
As I'm writing this post, our chairman Jim Jagielski is giving the traditional "State of the Feather" talk at <a title="ApacheCon EU" href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/c/aceu2009/">ApacheCon Europe 2009</a>. Today, the ASF comprises nearly 300 individual Members and over 2,000 Committers collaborating across six continents - that makes our founders proud! </p>
<p>Our press team has collected some <a href="http://www.apache.org/press/highlights.html" title="ASF Highlights 1999-2009">highlights</a> of the last ten years, and they are impressive.</p>
<p>
As part of its 10th Anniversary, the ASF will be highlighting various projects, initiatives, individuals, and organizations from the Apache community throughout the year. The Foundation's ongoing celebrations will culminate at <a href="http://www.us.apachecon.com/c/acus2009/">ApacheCon US 2009</a>, taking place 2-6 November 2009 in Oakland, California.</p>
<p>
Please join us in congratulating all the people who make the ASF possible, and who played a role in getting it to where it is today. The ASF would go nowhere without the countless volunteers who are the backbone of the Foundation!</p>
