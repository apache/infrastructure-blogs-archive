  <div>The Apache Software Foundation is the world's largest Open Source foundation. The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates more than 350 enterprise-grade projects that serve as the backbone for some of the most visible and widely used applications in computing today. From artificial intelligence and deep learning, Big Data, build management, Cloud computing, content management, DevOps, IoT and Edge computing, mobile, servers, Web frameworks, and many other categories, all Apache software products are available to the public-at-large at 100% no cost, and benefit billions of users around the world.</div>
