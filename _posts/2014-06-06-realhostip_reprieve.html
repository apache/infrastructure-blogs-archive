<p>As mentioned previously, the <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/realhostip_service_is_being_retired">realhostip.com dynamic DNS resolver service is being retired this summer</a>. During testing of Apache CloudStack version 4.3, we found a few more issues related to realhostip.com that have been addressed for the 4.4 release.</p>
<p>In order to give everybody a reasonable window to update their CloudStack installations to use the updated code, the retirement date for the realhostip.com service has been pushed back to <b>September 30th, 2014</b>. This provides an additional 3 months from the original June 30th date.</p>
<p>Any questions related to the retirement of the realhostip.com service and it's affect on CloudStack installations should be send to the CloudStack Users or Development mailing lists. Further information about how to subscribe and interact with the mailing lists is available at <a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html">https://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html</a>.</p>
