<p><b>Who:</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF): all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives.

</p>
  <p><b>What:</b> In development for nearly 10 years, and an ASF Top-Level Project since 2003, Apache Maven is the build system of choice for millions of developers and thousands of organizations world-wide.

</p>
  <p><b>Why:</b> Maven 3 represents the culmination of nearly two years of work re-architecting the internals of the system based on experience gained over the last five years with Maven 2.x. Maven 3 is faster, more reliable, and more extensible, with users already reporting 10-40% improvements in build time over Maven 2.

</p>
  <p>&quot;A key priority for our users was backward compatibility,&quot; said Brian Fox, Vice President of Apache Maven. &quot;We've invested a significant amount of time and effort to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining backward compatibility with Maven 2 builds and plugins.&quot;

</p>
  <p>Highlights of the release include:

    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parallel build capability
    </li>
    <li>Conversion of IoC system from Plexus to Guice, including a Plexus compatibility layer</li>
    <li>Rewritten dependency resolution logic, designed to be extensible and embedded in other applications </li>
    <li>Improved POM validation during the build to warn users of potential problems </li>
    <li>Improved error handling and messages </li>
    <li>Decoupled reporting engine from the core </li>
    <li>New inheritance and interpolation code designed to be extensible and allow composition of POMs in future releases </li>
    <li>More robust handling of local repository data </li>
    <li>True plugin classpath isolation </li>
    <li>Massively improved regression test suite for Maven core and plugins


</li>
  </ul>
