<p><b><i>Sponsorship boosts operational support for Apache projects and community</i></b></p>
<p><b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash;17 February 2015&ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Cloudera has renewed its sponsorship of the ASF with an upgrade to the Platinum level.</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>"We are grateful for Cloudera's continued generous support, which, in turn, helps advance the efforts of the Apache community at-large," said ASF President Ross Gardler. "Sponsoring the ASF helps provide critical infrastructure and support services that keep the Foundation running on a day-to-day basis."</p>
<p>As a United States 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF relies on individual donors and corporate sponsors to help bolster existing projects, incubate new initiatives, and promote meritocratic, community-driven development "The Apache Way".</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>An ASF Sponsor since 2011, Cloudera is recognized as a champion and active contributor to numerous Apache projects, including Avro, Hadoop, HBase, Hive, Pig, Whirr, and Zookeeper.&nbsp;</p>
</p></div>
<p>"Open source software has proven a powerful engine for innovation," said Mike Olson, Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Cloudera. "It harnesses the talent and creativity of the global community of developers. Participation in that community is critical. Cloudera has long been a proud member of the ASF. Developers on the Cloudera payroll have created and contributed to ASF projects, working closely with their peers in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. Our platinum sponsorship of the ASF complements our active contribution of code. The organization provides essential governance and community support on which our business relies. This donation, and our ongoing commitment, allows the ASF to deepen its investment in community, collaboration and innovation."</p>
