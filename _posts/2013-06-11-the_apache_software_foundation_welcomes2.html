<div>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) held its annual Members' meeting this May. Among the Foundation's business that takes place during this meeting is the election of new ASF Members.</p>
<p>At its inception in 1999, The ASF comprised 21 individuals who oversaw the progress of the Apache HTTP Server. This group formed the Foundation's core membership.</p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This group grew with "Committers", developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation, and were subsequently granted access by the Membership: </p>
<p>&nbsp; 1) to "commit" or "write" (contribute) directly to the code repository; </p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) the right to vote on community-related decisions; and </p>
<p>&nbsp; 3) and the ability propose an active user for Committership</p></p>
<p>Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation&rsquo;s growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing members. There are currently 468 active Apache Members.</p>
</p></div>
<div>ASF Members are elected bi-annually. New Members elected at the May 2013 Members' meeting are:</div>
