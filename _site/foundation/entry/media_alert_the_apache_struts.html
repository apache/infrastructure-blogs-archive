<meta name="description" content="Apache Struts 2 recommended as an elegant Open Source, extensible successor framework for creating enterprise-ready Java Web applications Forest Hill, MD &ndash;9 April 2013&ndash; WHO: The Apache Software Foundation&#39;s Apache Struts Project, creators of leading Open Source solutions for creating Java web applications. WHAT: The Struts&trade; 1.x Web framework has reached its end-of-life (EOL) and is no longer officially supported. Created in 2000 to provide an improved development experience over pure Java Server Pages (JSP) utilization, Apache Struts 1 soon became the de-facto standard for Java-based Web application development. Numerous companies world-wide adopted Struts 1 as a strategic platform, even after JSF (Java Server Faces) was introduced as a standardized Java EE framework for Web application development. Its popularity was so prevalent in the early 2000s, most job offerings in the space of Java-based Web technology required Struts 1 as a must-have skill.&nbsp; Today, many important Websites and Web-based user interfaces continue to rely on Struts 1 technology. In addition, many popular Web frameworks, such as Spring MVC and WebWork, were significantly inspired by Struts 1. WHEN: The Apache Struts Project Management Committee is not aware of any urgent issues posing the immediate need to eliminate Struts 1 usage. However, the project&#39;s EOL status signifies that security and bug fixes will no longer be provided effective immediately. The Apache Struts project recommends new projects to be developed using Struts 2 as opposed to Struts 1. While any action-based Java web framework is a potential candidate to re-use Struts 1 architectural experience or migrate existing Struts-1-based applications, users are highly advised to investigate Struts 2 as a successor framework. WHY: Struts 2 is modern, highly decoupled, feature rich, well maintained, and successfully running in many mission-critical projects globally. It shares the same basic principles with Struts 1, and offers a highly improved architecture, API, and solution portfolio. WHERE: The last release of Apache Struts 1 is version 1.3.10 from December 2008. All software downloads, notices, and updates are available at the Apache Struts project homepage at http://struts.apache.org/. NEXT STEPS: The Struts community continues its focus on pushing the Apache Struts 2 framework forward, with as many as 23 releases to date.&nbsp; Availability and Oversight Apache Struts software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&#39;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases. Apache Struts source code, documentation, mailing lists, and related resources are available at http://struts.apache.org/.&nbsp; About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world&#39;s most popular Web server software.
