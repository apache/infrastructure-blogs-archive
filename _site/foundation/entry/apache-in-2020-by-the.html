The core Apache Group of 21 individual Members grew with developers who contributed code, patches, or documentation. Some of these contributors were subsequently granted Committer status by the Membership, and provided access to: 1) commit code directly to Apache repositories; 2) vote on community-related decisions; and 3) propose an active user for Committership. Today, ASF Committers contribute not just code and documentation, but also an array of initiatives that provide value across the greater Apache ecosystem, including Project promotion and community development through mentoring, events, and diversity and inclusion programs. Those Committers who demonstrate merit in the Foundation's growth, evolution, and progress are nominated for ASF Membership by existing members.</span></p>
