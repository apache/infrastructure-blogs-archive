<p>The Apache OpenWebBeans team is proud to announce the release of Apache Meecrowave 1.2.0</p>
<p>Apache Meecrowave is a small server (only 9MB) fully based on JavaEE 8 technologies</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache Tomcat-9.0.2 (Servlets-4.0)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache OpenWebBeans-2.0.3 (CDI-2.0)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache Johnzon-1.1.5 (JSON-P-1.1 and JSON-B-1.0), and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache CXF-3.2.1 (JAX-RS-2.1).</p>
<p>That means it is ideally suited for Microservices and standalone applications.</p>
<p>Meecrowave can be either started via a maven plugin (for ease of development), programmatically as embedded server, bundled as application with your business code or as runner to start up portable WAR or JAR applications.</p>
<p>The source distribution package can be downloaded from our mirrors:<br />https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/openwebbeans/meecrowave/1.2.0</p>
<p>Hashes can be found here<br />https://www.apache.org/dist/openwebbeans/meecrowave/1.2.0</p>
<p>The binary artifacts are available on maven.central:<br />https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/meecrowave/</p>
<p>More info can be found at<br />https://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/</p>
