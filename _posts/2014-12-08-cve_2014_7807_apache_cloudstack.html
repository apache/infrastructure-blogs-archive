<p>CVE-2014-7807: Apache CloudStack unauthenticated LDAP binds</p>
<p>CVSS:<br><br />
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P</p>
<p>Vendors:<br><br />
The Apache Software Foundation<br><br />
Citrix, Inc.</p>
<p>Versions Afffected:<br><br />
Apache CloudStack 4.3, 4.4</p>
<p>Description:<br><br />
Apache CloudStack may be configured to authenticate LDAP users.<br />
When so configured, it performs a simple LDAP bind with the name<br />
and password provided by a user.  Simple LDAP binds are defined<br />
with three mechanisms (RFC 4513): 1) username and password; 2)<br />
unauthenticated if only a username is specified; and 3) anonymous<br />
if neither username or password is specified.  Currently, Apache<br />
CloudStack does not check if the password was provided which could<br />
allow an attacker to bind as an unauthenticated user.</p>
<p>Mitigation:<br><br />
Users of Apache CloudStack 4.4 and derivatives should update to the<br />
latest version (4.4.2)</p>
<p>An updated release for Apache CloudStack 4.3.2 is in testing. Until<br />
that is released, we recommend following the mitigation below:</p>
<p>By default, many LDAP servers are not configured to allow unauthenticated<br />
binds.  If the LDAP server in use allow this behaviour, a potential<br />
interim solution would be to consider disabling unauthenticated<br />
binds.</p>
