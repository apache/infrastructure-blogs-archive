<p> <b>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 27 February 2012 &ndash;</b> The Apache Software Foundation<br />
(ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly<br />
150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced that Apache<br />
ACE has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level<br />
Project (TLP), signifying that the Project's community and products have<br />
 been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</p>
<p>Apache ACE is a software distribution framework for managing and<br />
distributing modular software components, configuration data, and other<br />
artifacts to OSGi-based and related target systems.</p>
<p>Comprising a set of OSGi bundles, Apache ACE allows developers to easily<br />
 manage the dependencies, deployment, and feedback of installed software<br />
 components. This proves particularly useful when scaling across<br />
embedded and Cloud computing applications by covering the area of<br />
deploying and dynamically scaling applications in the cloud, as well as<br />
mobile platforms that would utilize ACE to create their own market or<br />
application store.</p>
<p>Using Apache ACE, updates and new components can be easily distributed<br />
while keeping a full history of what was installed where and during what<br />
 period. In addition, ACE helps developers set up an automated<br />
development, QA/testing, staging, and production environment.<br />
Initially donated to the Apache Incubator in 2009 by software solutions<br />
provider Luminis, a diverse and international group of developers joined<br />
 the initial developers of the ACE code base to successfully form the<br />
Apache ACE community.</p>
<p>"We are excited that ACE has successfully graduated as a Top-Level<br />
Project," said Marcel Offermans, Vice President of Apache ACE and Fellow<br />
 at Luminis. "Developing projects 'The Apache Way' stimulates widespread<br />
 cooperation with individuals that each bring their specific knowledge<br />
to the project. Diversity is key -- the community is evolving the<br />
project in new and interesting ways, leveraging the collective<br />
expertise."</p>
<p>Availability and Oversight<br />
Apache ACE software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is<br />
overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project. A<br />
 Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project's day-to-day<br />
operations, including community development and product releases. Apache<br />
 ACE source code, documentation, mailing lists, and related resources<br />
are available at <a href="http://ace.apache.org/">http://ace.apache.org/</a>.</p>
<p>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)<br />
Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one<br />
hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server<br />
 &mdash; the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's<br />
meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 350 individual<br />
 Members and 3,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely<br />
 available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users<br />
worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the<br />
Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing<br />
lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official<br />
user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is a US 501(3)(c)<br />
not-for-profit charity, funded by individual donations and corporate<br />
sponsors including AMD, Basis Technology, Cloudera, Facebook, Google,<br />
