<p>Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade<br />
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,<br />
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous<br />
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating<br />
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.</p>
<p>The artifacts may be downloaded from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html.</p>
<p>This release contains a fix for bug LOG4J2-2838.</p>
<p>Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.<br />
log4j-slf4j-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and log4j-slf4j18-impl should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and<br />
later.</p>
<p>Note that the default XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the "timeMillis"<br />
attribute and instead have an "Instant" element with "epochSecond" and "nanoOfSecond" attributes. If the previous<br />
behavior is desired the "includeTimeMillis" attribute may be set to true on each of the respective Layouts.</p>
<p>The Log4j 2.13.3 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.</p>

<p>Apache Log4j 2.13.3 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the<br />
