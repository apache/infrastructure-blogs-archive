    Hi all. Today, we will briefly show you about PHP7.4 support which will be available in the <b>next NetBeans version</b> i.e. <b>NetBeans 11.2</b>.</p>
<p>
    First of all, I strongly hope that new features are tested by PHP users before NetBeans 11.2 is released because there should be bugs.<br />
    Definitely, we need your help!</p>
<p>    If you are interested in them, please test it. You can download a dev version <a href="https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/NetBeans/job/netbeans-linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/">here</a>.</p>
<p>    Then, we could merge new changes quickly thanks to our committer <b>Tomas Mysik</b>. Thanks a lot for your review, Tomas!</p>
<h3>PHP 7.4 Support</h3>
<p>
    To enable it, you have to set PHP 7.4 as the PHP version of your PHP project. (Right-click your project node, click Project Properties.)</p>
<p><img src="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/120737486/nb112-php74-project-properties.png"/></p>
