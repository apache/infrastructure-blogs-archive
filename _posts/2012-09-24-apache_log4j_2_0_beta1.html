<p>The Apache Logging team is pleased to announce the Apache log4j 2.0-beta1 release!</p>
<p>Apache log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade to<br />
Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides<br />
many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logback's<br />
architecture.</p>
<p>This is the third release of Log4j 2 and is being made available to encourage use and feedback from the community.</p>
<h2>Bug fixes and enhancements</h2>
<p>Changes in this version include:</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added AsynchAppender</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed Bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOG4J-81:  PatternLayout was not honoring format modifiers.</li>
<li>Created web module to allow web applications to include the Log4j context listener in WEB-INF/lib even if<br />
        Log4j is in the container's class path. Allow locating the LoggerContext to include the ClassLoader. Updated<br />
        the Loader utility to always choose the child ClassLoader. Verified in Jboss 5 and Tomcat. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-82:  MarkerFilter called MarkerManager.getMarker causing the Marker to be created during the processing of the<br />
        configuration. This prevents the application from creating the Marker with any parents. MarkerWrapper in<br />
        SLF4J-impl was getting a ClassCastException in instanceOf because the Marker isn't a MarkerWrapper. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-80:  Allow Log4j 2 to be used as the implementation with SLF4J and SLF4J's jcl-over-slf4j by adding filtering<br />
        to the log method in SLF4JLogger. Thanks to Oliver Lamy. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-78:  LogFactoryImpl.setAttribute in the Commons Logging bridge got a NullPointerException when passed a null value.<br />
        It will now remove the attribute. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-77:  RoutingAppender was calling the stop method for each of its referenced Appenders and was calling<br />
        the stop method of the default Appender a second time. It will now only call the stop method of<br />
        Appenders it creates. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-76:  RewriteAppender was calling the stop method of the referenced appender causing the referenced appender's<br />
        manager to have its use count decremented too many times. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-74:  Logger.error(Marker, Message, Throwable) was internally using Level.TRACE. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-75:  Enhanced Log4jContextListener to accept a configuration file location. Modified FileConfigurationMonitor<br />
        to monitor files configured that way. Fixed other reconfiguration related bugs. Tested in JBoss and<br />
        Tomcat. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-72:  NullPointerException in RollingFileManager when filePattern does not cause the file to be compressed. </li>
<li>LOG4J2-71:  FileRenameAction did not create the parent directories of the archive files causing the rollover to fail. </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the versions of SLF4J and Logback. </li>
</ul>
<p>Apache Log4j 2.0-beta1 requires a minimum of Java 5 to build and run. Basic compatibility with<br />
Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j12-api component, however it does not implement some of the<br />
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to<br />
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
