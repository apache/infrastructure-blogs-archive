<meta name="description" content="Apache OFBiz News September 2016 Welcome to our regular monthly round-up of OFBiz news. This month we have news about an OFBiz track for Apachecon EU, a new Community HipChat room is setup, our PMC grows larger, OFBiz gets a new plug in system and the community collaborates on yet another Community Day. Apachecon EU 2016 - Seville The community submitted a range of talks for Apachecon EU in Seville. Five OFBiz talks have been selected to make up an OFBiz track. The topics range from improving the OFBiz user experience through to the new OFBiz plug in management system. It&#39;s great to see another OFBiz track at Apachecon as it gives an opportunity for our community to meet face to face, get to know each other and collaborate. Our speakers will be coming from France, India and Kuwait. . Full details of the OFBiz track can be found at the following link: OFBiz Track Thank you to everyone that made a submission. We hope that there will be a strong OFBiz presence in Seville including some of our committers and PMC members. If you are interested in coming to Apachecon, then please register via the Linux Foundation website. OFBiz Community HipChat Room This month a HipChat room was setup for the OFBiz Community. The room is open to anyone to join and can be accessed using the following link OFBiz HipChat Room It is hoped that the online chat forum can help with collaboration, mentoring and also as a way to build community spirit. People can easily see other community members online, ask simple questions and chat about OFBiz. As usual any discussions topics are taken back to the mailing lists. The HipChat room has been very successful and was used during the this month&#39;s Community Day. OFBiz Community Day Our Community Days are held every 3 months and our third one for 2016 was held on 17th September. As usual they are very popular. Once again the activity level was very high with 103 commits and 82 tickets closed or resolved. OFBiz was showing up on the ASF Status Monitor as the most active project over the Community Day weekend with Michael Brohl, Pranay Pandey, Arun Patidar, Jacques Le Roux and Gil Portenseigne filling the list of the top 5 most active Committers. Thanks to everyone for their contributions, involvement and great effort. Our next Community Day is planned for 17th December. If you are interested in taking part then mark the date in your diary. OFBiz Plug In Manager A lot of work has been done this month to create a plug in management system for OFBiz. OFBiz covers many business aspects that being able to create a plug in and choose what functionality you want to enable will be a very strong and flexible business feature. The change of build system from Ant to Gradle has made the implementation of a plug in system for OFBiz a lot easier and after many weeks of effort the code has now been added to the trunk. This means that it will be included as part of the next OFBiz release. Huge thanks and kudos to Taher Alkhateeb for doing all the hard work! New PMC Member A new member has joined the OFBiz Project Management Committee (PMC) this month - Michael Brohl. Congratulations Michael!

This month we have news about an OFBiz track for Apachecon EU, a new Community HipChat room is setup, our PMC grows larger, OFBiz gets a new plug in system and the community collaborates on yet another Community Day. Apachecon EU 2016 - Seville The community submitted a range of talks for Apachecon EU in Seville. Five OFBiz talks have been selected to make up an OFBiz track. The topics range from improving the OFBiz user experience through to the new OFBiz plug in management system. It&#39;s great to see another OFBiz track at Apachecon as it gives an opportunity for our community to meet face to face, get to know each other and collaborate. Our speakers will be coming from France, India and Kuwait. . Full details of the OFBiz track can be found at the following link: OFBiz Track Thank you to everyone that made a submission. We hope that there will be a strong OFBiz presence in Seville including some of our committers and PMC members. If you are interested in coming to Apachecon, then please register via the Linux Foundation website. OFBiz Community HipChat Room This month a HipChat room was setup for the OFBiz Community. The room is open to anyone to join and can be accessed using the following link OFBiz HipChat Room It is hoped that the online chat forum can help with collaboration, mentoring and also as a way to build community spirit. People can easily see other community members online, ask simple questions and chat about OFBiz. As usual any discussions topics are taken back to the mailing lists. The HipChat room has been very successful and was used during the this month&#39;s Community Day. OFBiz Community Day Our Community Days are held every 3 months and our third one for 2016 was held on 17th September. As usual they are very popular. Once again the activity level was very high with 103 commits and 82 tickets closed or resolved. OFBiz was showing up on the ASF Status Monitor as the most active project over the Community Day weekend with Michael Brohl, Pranay Pandey, Arun Patidar, Jacques Le Roux and Gil Portenseigne filling the list of the top 5 most active Committers. Thanks to everyone for their contributions, involvement and great effort. Our next Community Day is planned for 17th December. If you are interested in taking part then mark the date in your diary. OFBiz Plug In Manager A lot of work has been done this month to create a plug in management system for OFBiz. OFBiz covers many business aspects that being able to create a plug in and choose what functionality you want to enable will be a very strong and flexible business feature. The change of build system from Ant to Gradle has made the implementation of a plug in system for OFBiz a lot easier and after many weeks of effort the code has now been added to the trunk. This means that it will be included as part of the next OFBiz release. Huge thanks and kudos to Taher Alkhateeb for doing all the hard work! New PMC Member A new member has joined the OFBiz Project Management Committee (PMC) this month - Michael Brohl. Congratulations Michael!

<p>It's great to see another OFBiz track at Apachecon as it gives an opportunity for our community to meet face to face, get to know each other and collaborate. Our speakers will be coming from France, India and Kuwait. . Full details of the OFBiz track can be found at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://apacheconeu2016.sched.org/overview/type/ofbiz">OFBiz Track </a> </p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that made a submission. We hope that there will be a strong OFBiz presence in Seville including some of our committers and PMC members. If you are interested in coming to Apachecon, then please register via the <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-europe/attend/register"> Linux Foundation </a> website.</p>
<h2>OFBiz Community HipChat Room</h2>
<p>This month a HipChat room was setup for the OFBiz Community. The room is open to anyone to join and can be accessed using the following link</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hipchat.com/g4vOayvmc">OFBiz HipChat Room </a> </p>
<p>It is hoped that the online chat forum can help with collaboration, mentoring and also as a way to build community spirit. People can easily see other community members online, ask simple questions and chat about OFBiz. As usual any discussions topics are taken back to the mailing lists.</p>
<p>The HipChat room has been very successful and was used during the this month's Community Day.</p>
<h2>OFBiz Community Day</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/OFBiz+Community+Days">Community Days</a>  are held every 3 months and our third one for 2016 was held on 17th September. As usual they are very popular. Once again the activity level was very high with 103 commits and 82 tickets closed or resolved.  OFBiz was showing up on the ASF Status Monitor as the most active project over the Community Day weekend with Michael Brohl, Pranay Pandey, Arun Patidar, Jacques Le Roux and Gil Portenseigne filling the list of the top 5 most active Committers. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for their contributions, involvement and great effort. Our next Community Day is planned for 17th December.  If you are interested in taking part then mark the date in your diary.</p>
<h2>OFBiz Plug In Manager</h2>
<p>A lot of work has been done this month to create a plug in management system for OFBiz. OFBiz covers many business aspects that being able to create a plug in and choose what functionality you want to enable will be a very strong and flexible business feature. The change of build system from Ant to Gradle has made the implementation of a plug in system for OFBiz a lot easier and after many weeks of effort the code has now been added to the trunk. This means that it will be included as part of the next OFBiz release. </p>
<p>Huge thanks and kudos to Taher Alkhateeb for doing all the hard work!</p>
<h2>New PMC Member</h2>
<p>A new member has joined the OFBiz Project Management Committee (PMC) this month - Michael Brohl. Congratulations Michael! </p>
