Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich APIs for managing the compute, networking, software, and storage infrastructure resources. CloudStack became an Apache Top-level Project (TLP) in March 2013. &quot;We are proud to announce CloudStack v4.3,&quot; said Hugo Trippaers, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. &quot;This release represents over six months of work from the Apache CloudStack community with many new and improved features.&quot; Under The Hood CloudStack V4.3 is the next feature release of the 4.x line which first released on November 6, 2012. Some of the noteworthy new and improved features include: Support for Microsoft Hyper-V - Apache CloudStack can now manage Hyper-V hypervisors in addition to KVM, XenServer, VMware, LXC, and Bare Metal Juniper OpenContrail integration - OpenContrail is a software defined networking controller from Juniper that CloudStack now integrates with to provide SDN services SSL Termination support for guest VMs - Apache CloudStack can configure and manage SSL termination in certain load balancer devices Palo Alto Firewall integration - Apache CloudStack can now manage and configure Palo Alto firewalls Remote access VPN for VPC networks - CloudStack&#39;s remote access VPN is now available for Virtual Private Cloud networks Site to Site VPN between VRs - CloudStack now allows site-to-site VPN connectivity to it&#39;s virtual routing devices. This permits your cloud computing environment to appear as a natural extension of your local network, or for you to easily interconnect multiple environments VXLAN support expansion to include KVM - CloudStack&#39;s support for integrating VXLAN, the network virtualization technology that attempts to ameliorate scalability problems with traditional networking SolidFire plugin extension to support KVM and hypervisor snapshots for XenServer and ESX - SolidFire provides guaranteed Storage Quality of Service at the Virtual Machine level Dynamic Compute offering - CloudStack now has the ability to dynamically scale the resources assigned to a running virtual machine instance for those hypervisors which support it Downloads and Documentation The official source code for the v4.3 release, as well as individual contributors&#39; convenience binaries, can be downloaded from the Apache CloudStack downloads page at http://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html The CloudStack 4.3 release includes over 110 issues from 4.2.0 and 4.2.1, including fixes for object storage support, documentation, and more.
