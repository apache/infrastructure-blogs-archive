<meta name="description" content="Groundbreaking, lightweight, scalable, all-Apache stack ideal for use in enterprise-grade Cloud applications The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced that Apache TomEE has obtained certification as Java EE 6 Web Profile Compatible Implementation. Making its certification debut at JavaOne, Apache TomEE (pronounced &quot;Tommy&quot;) is the Java Enterprise Edition of Apache Tomcat (Tomcat + Java EE = TomEE) that unites several quality Java enterprise projects including Apache OpenEJB, Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache OpenJPA, Apache MyFaces and more. &quot;It is with great pride that we&#39;re announcing Apache TomEE as a certified implementation of the Java EE 6 Web Profile,&quot; said David Blevins, Vice President of Apache OpenEJB and original co-developer of TomEE. &quot;Apache TomEE is the newest addition to the Java EE server space, standing alongside the likes of GlassFish, JBoss, and Apache Geronimo.&quot; Developers build applications using Java EE-certified products to ensure portability across Java Enterprise Edition-compatible solutions. Apache TomEE is one of only six certified implementations available to the industry today. Redefining Enterprise Cloud; Unifying Communities The three core design objectives for TomEE were: 1) do not alter Tomcat; 2) maintain simplicity; and 3) avoid architecture overhead. This enables developers to quickly and easily build highly performant lightweight enterprise solutions using leading Apache projects without the need for complex modifications or customization. Apache TomEE&#39;s integration of Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache MyFaces, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache OpenJPA, and Apache CXFis simple, to-the-point, and focused on the singular task of delivering the Java EE 6 Web Profile in a minimalist fashion. The simple, all-Apache stack is both incredibly light and fully embeddable, making it ideal for testing and usage in today&#39;s evolution of the enterprise Cloud, where the key to scalability is hundreds of tiny servers, as opposed to the traditional definition of how large your servers. Apache TomEE boasts groundbreaking performance in the following areas: - Size: exceptionally small (about 24MB for the entire Web profile), consumes very little resources; - Memory: TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) passed with no additional memory settings beyond the default &ndash; a first in Java EE; and - Speed: runs exceptionally fast in embedded mode: start/deploy/test/undeploy/stop in 2-3 seconds. &quot;No longer do developers have to ask &#39;Do we use Tomcat or Java EE?&#39; at the start of a project, as has been the case for the last 10 years,&quot; explained Blevins. &quot;These two camps have historically been separate, and certification is a major step in unifying these communities. With TomEE, developers can now retire untested legacy stacks and use a reliable product that doesn&#39;t deviate from the Tomcat that they know and love.&quot; Blevins and members of the Apache OpenEJB community will be presenting several sessions, including &quot;TomEE &ndash; Tomcat with a Kick&quot;, in the &quot;Servers/Tomcat &amp; Geronimo&quot; track at ApacheCon, 7-11 November 2011, in Vancouver, Canada.
