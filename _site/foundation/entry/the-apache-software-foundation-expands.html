As the world&#39;s largest Open Source foundation, the ASF&#39;s 200M+ lines of code are overseen by an all-volunteer community of 730 individual ASF Members and 7,000 Apache code committers. Over its 20 year history, 1,058,321,099 lines of code have been committed across 3,022,836 code commits. Apache projects initially had two version control services available via ASF Infrastructure: Apache Subversion and Git. Through the years, an increasing number of projects and their communities wanted to see their source code available on GitHub. As these were read-only mirrors, the ability to use GitHub&#39;s tools around those repositories was limited. &quot;In 2016, the Foundation started integrating GitHub&#39;s repository and tooling, with our own services. This enabled selected projects to use GitHub&#39;s excellent tools,&quot; said Greg Stein, ASF Infrastructure Administrator. &quot;Over time, we improved, debugged, and solidified this integration. In late 2018, we asked all projects to move away from our internal git service, to that provided by GitHub. This shift brought all of their tooling to our projects, while we maintain a backup mirror on our infrastructure.&quot; GitHub makes it easier for developers to work together, to solve challenging problems, and to create the world&rsquo;s most important technologies. The platform enables teams to host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside 31M+ developers, 2M+ businesses and organizations, and across 100M+ repositories. &quot;We&#39;re proud to have such a long standing member of the Open Source community migrate to GitHub,&quot; said Nat Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of GitHub. &quot;Whether we&#39;re working with individual Open Source maintainers and contributors or some of the world&#39;s largest Open Source foundations like Apache, GitHub&#39;s mission is to be the home for all developers by supporting Open Source communities, addressing their unique needs, and helping Open Source projects thrive.&quot; In February 2019, the migration to GitHub was complete, and the ASF&#39;s own git service was decommissioned. &quot;We continue to experiment and expand the set of services that GitHub can provide to our communities, given our own needs and requirements,&quot; added Stein. &quot;The Foundation has started working closely with GitHub management to explore ways to make this happen, and what will be possible in the future.&quot; To learn more on ASF Infrastructure, visit https://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html For performance statistics, visit https://www.apache.org/uptime/ About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than 350 leading Open Source projects that provide $20B+ worth of Apache Open Source software to the public at 100% no cost.
