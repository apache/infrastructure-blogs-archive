<p>Adam Bien writes in is popular weblog an nice entry called <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/how_to_unit_test_ejb">How To Unit-Test EJB 3 ...in 0.8 Seconds</a>.  As the subject implies he covers using OpenEJB for fast and light EJB 3.0 unit testing.  </p>
<p>Adam has been working on a new project called <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/javaee-patterns/">Project Kenai</a> which aims to take a fresh look at Java EE design patterns.  So many J2EE design patterns deal with things which were similified or eliminated altogether in EJB 3.0.  It's about time someone came out with some new material.</p>
<p>Great work Adam!  Thanks for ensuring your examples run on OpenEJB!</p>
