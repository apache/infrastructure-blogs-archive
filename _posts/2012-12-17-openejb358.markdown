We are proud to announce <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/downloads.html">Apache TomEE 1.5.1</a> has been released!

Though targeted as a maintenance release, does include some neat new features such as a Maven Archetype for quickly creating TomEE projects, the ability to reduce JPA scanning overhead, new options in the Arquillian adapters and some enhancements to the TomEE Maven Plugin.  Key upgrades include Apache Tomcat 7.0.34, Apache ActiveMQ 5.7.0, Apache CXF 2.6.3 and Apache MyFaces 2.1.10.  Noteworthy bugfixes include some Windows-specific fixes and CDI changes to better support EARs.
