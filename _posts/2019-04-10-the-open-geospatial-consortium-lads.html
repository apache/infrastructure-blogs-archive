<div><strong><em>Call for Presentations outlining Apache projects that include geospatial data and processing closes 13 May.</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is pleased to announce that, after a successful geospatial track at last year's ApacheCon North America, OGC will once again lead a conference track concerning geospatial data and processing at ApacheCon NA 2019, to be held in Las Vegas on 9-12 September. Developers are invited to propose to present, and interested organizations are welcome to sponsor the track.</div>
<div>
<p>"We are delighted to collaborate once again with the Open Geospatial Consortium on the Geospatial Track at ApacheCon," said Rich Bowen, ASF Vice President Conferences and Event Chair for ApacheCon North America. "OGC's involvement reflects both the interest and participation in a growing number of Apache projects. We are happy to make ApacheCon the home for meaningful, community-curated content for the greater geospatial community."</p>
</p></div>
<div>The single-day Geospatial Track at ApacheCon NA 2019 will occur on Monday, 9 September, and provide an opportunity for participants to learn about, discuss, and see examples of the implementation of geospatial information across Apache projects.</div></p>
<div>
<p>Multiple Apache projects include geospatial information and processing. The Geospatial Track will consider a range of geospatial implementations ranging from location as an attribute, to projects that perform spatial analytics, including handling of coordinate reference systems (CRSs), geometries, and arrays. Emphasis is invited on the use of open standards, including OGC's recently updated CRS Well Known Text, version 2. The Geospatial Track will foster discussions that will reduce development effort through the reuse and increased quality of geospatial information handling.</p>
</p></div>
<div>2019 marks the third time OGC has lead the Geospatial Track at ApacheCon NA, with previous tracks being run in 2016 and 2018.</div>
<p>Discussions about this track are invited on geospatial@apache.org.&nbsp;</p>
<div>To submit a presentation for the ApacheCon NA 2019 Geospatial Track, follow the instructions on the <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna19/cfp.html">ApacheCon NA 2019 Call For Presentations</a> page, and select 'Geospatial software' as your topic on the submission form. The Call for Presentations will close the morning of 13 May.</div>

<div><strong>About OGC<br /></strong>The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of more than 525 companies, government agencies, research organizations, and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geospatial standards. OGC standards support interoperable solutions that 'geo-enable' the Web, wireless and location-based services, and mainstream IT. OGC standards empower technology developers to make geospatial information and services accessible and useful within any application that needs to be geospatially enabled. Visit the OGC Website at <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">http://www.opengeospatial.org/</a></div>
<p><strong>About ApacheCon<br /></strong>ApacheCon is the official global conference series of The Apache Software Foundation. Since 1998, ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore "Tomorrow's Technology Today" across 300+ Apache projects and their diverse communities. ApacheCon showcases the latest developments in ubiquitous Apache projects and emerging innovations through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, community events, and more. ApacheCon attendees will also be joining The Apache Software Foundation in celebrating its 20th Anniversary at both its North America and Europe events.
