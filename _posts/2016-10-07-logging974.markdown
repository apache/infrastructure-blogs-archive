<p>The Apache Log4j 2 team is pleased to announce the Log4j 2.7 release!

</p><p>
Apache Log4j is a well known framework for logging application behavior. Log4j 2 is an upgrade
to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides
many other modern features such as support for Markers, lambda expressions for lazy logging,
property substitution using Lookups, multiple patterns on a PatternLayout and asynchronous
Loggers. Another notable Log4j 2 feature is the ability to be "garbage-free" (avoid allocating
temporary objects) while logging. In addition, Log4j 2 will not lose events while reconfiguring.

</p><p>
This release contains several bugfixes and new features. The new features include new logging API
modules for Scala 2.10 and 2.11, and support for various non-blocking queue implementations in
AsyncAppender. Furthermore the ThreadContext map can now be configured to be garbage-free, and
users can now inject context data from other sources than ThreadContext. Context data values can
be any Object, not just Strings. More details on the fixes are itemized below.

</p><p>
Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the
addition of new methods to the Logger interface. If you have code that does:
</p><p>

<tt>logger.error(null, “This is the log message”, throwable);</tt>
</p><p>

or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.
To correct this either do:
</p><p>

<tt>logger.error(“This is the log message”, throwable);</tt>

</p><p>
or
</p><p>

<tt>logger.error((Marker) null, “This is the log message”, throwable);</tt>
</p><p>

The Log4j 2.7 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

</ul>

<p>Apache Log4j 2.7 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run. Log4j 2.3 was the last release that
supported Java 6.</p>

<p>Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the log4j-1.2-api component, however it does not implement some of the
very implementation specific classes and methods. The package names and Maven groupId have been changed to
org.apache.logging.log4j to avoid any conflicts with log4j 1.x.</p>
