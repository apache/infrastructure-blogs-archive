<p>The Apache 
Software Foundation has <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-community/201012.mbox/%3C64C623FF-90E7-48C0-A371-C53B848CB4DE@pobox.com%3E">resigned its seat</a> on the Java SE/EE Executive 
Committee.&nbsp; Apache has served on the EC for the past 10 years, winning 
the JCP &quot;Member of the Year&quot; award 4 times, and recently was ratified 
for another term with support from 95% of the voting community.&nbsp; 
Further, the project communities of the ASF, home to Apache Tomcat, Ant,
 Xerces, Geronimo, Velocity and nearly a 100 mainstay java components 
have implemented countless JSRs and serve on and contribute to many of 
the JCPs technical expert groups.&nbsp; <br /><br />We'd like to provide some explanation to the community as to why we're taking this significant step.<br /><br />The
 recent Java SE 7 vote was the last chance for the JCP EC to demonstrate
 that the EC has any intent to defend the JCP as an open specification 
process, and demonstrate that the letter and spirit of the law 
matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the issues at stake in the vote, we believe that 
while continuing to fail to uphold their responsibilities under the 
JSPA, Oracle provided the EC with a Java SE 7 specification request and 
license that are self-contradictory, severely restrict distribution of 
independent implementations of the spec, and most importantly, prohibit 
the distribution of independent open source implementations of the 
spec.&nbsp; Oracle has refused to answer any reasonable and responsible 
questions from the EC regarding these problems.<br /><br />In the phrase 
&quot;fail to uphold their responsibilities under the JSPA&quot;, we are referring
 to Oracle's refusal to provide the ASF's Harmony project with a TCK 
license for Java SE that complies with Oracle's obligations under the 
JSPA as well as public promises made to the Java community by officers 
of Sun Microsystems (recently acquired by Oracle.)&nbsp; This breach of the 
JSPA was begun by Sun Microsystems in August of 2006 and is a policy 
that Oracle explicitly continues today.&nbsp; For more information on this 
dispute, see our <a href="http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html">open letter to Sun Microsystems</a>.<br /><br />This 
vote was the only real power the Executive Committee has as the 
governing body of the Java specification ecosystem, and as we <a href="http://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/statement_by_the_asf_board1">indicated 
previously</a> we were looking for the EC to protect the rights of 
implementers to the degree they are able, as well as preserve the 
integrity of the JCP licensing structure by ensuring that JCP 
specifications are able to be freely implemented and distributed.&nbsp; We 
don't believe this is an unreasonable position - it should be noted that
 the majority of the EC members, including Oracle, have publicly stated 
that restrictions on distribution such as those found in the Java SE 7 
license have no place in the JCP - and two distinguished individual 
members of the EC, <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/jcp22oct10.html">Doug Lea</a> and <a href="http://tembrel.blogspot.com/2010/12/resigned-from-ec.html">Tim Peierls</a>, both have resigned in 
protest over the same issue.<br /><br />By approving Java SE 7, the 
EC has failed on both counts : the members of the EC refused to stand up
 for the rights of implementers, and by accepting Oracle's TCK license 
terms for Java SE 7, they let the integrity of the JCP's licensing 
structure be broken.<br /><br />The Apache Software Foundation concludes 
that that JCP is not an open specification process - that Java 
specifications are proprietary technology that must be licensed directly
 from the spec lead under whatever terms the spec lead chooses; that the
 commercial concerns of a single entity, Oracle, will continue to 
seriously interfere with and bias the transparent governance of the 
ecosystem;&nbsp; that it is impossible to distribute independent 
implementations of JSRs under open source licenses such that users are 
protected from IP litigation by expert group members or the spec lead; 
and finally, the EC is unwilling or unable to assert the basic power of 
their role in the JCP governance process.<br /><br />In short, the EC and the Java Community Process are neither.<br /><br />To
 that end, our representative has informed the JCP's Program Management 
Office of our resignation, effective immediately.&nbsp; As such, the ASF is 
removing all official representatives from any and all JSRs. In 
addition, we will refuse any renewal of our JCP membership and, of 
course, our EC position.</p>
