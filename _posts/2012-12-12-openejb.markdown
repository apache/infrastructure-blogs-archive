If you love and use TomEE and want good things to come to it, share your experience!  We've created a new <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/105208241852045684449">Google+ Community for TomEE</a> with a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/105208241852045684449/stream/ca33d312-8470-4f0b-a5a2-8ade02160bb2">"User Stories" section</a> where anyone can post.  Take 5 minutes and say how TomEE has helped you and what you like about it.

Sharing your experience is the best possible "thank you" the hard working TomEE community can get!  Helping the community that helps you is good karma! :)
