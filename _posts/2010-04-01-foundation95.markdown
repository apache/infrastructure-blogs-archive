<p>Today, the Apache Software Foundation announced it has agreed to
sell all IP and assets of the foundation to Oracle. The agreement is
a $1.5 billion all cash deal. The ASF board agreed to the terms
after vigorous discussions last evening.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&quot;We never considered the possibility of selling the ASF,&quot; said Jim
Jagielski, Chairman of the ASF, &quot;but Oracle made us a simply fantastic
offer. Larry himself flew out last week to meet with us to address
our concerns.&quot;
</p>
  <p>
As part of the agreement, Oracle obtains even more of the crucial
LAMP-stack software products.

</p>
  <p>&quot;It was Oracle's admission that the Web is more than 'just' Java
or databases that finalized the decision for us,&quot; said Justin Erenkrantz,
Director and President of the ASF.
</p>
  <p>
2009 marked the 10th Anniversary of the ASF.</p>
  <p>We will be communicating updates about the status of our projects and our license in the near future.&nbsp; As a community based organization, we want to ensure the best experience for our existing committers, contributors, and users, under our new arrangement.<br /></p>
