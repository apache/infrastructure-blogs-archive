<meta name="description" content="Mature, efficient &quot;SQL-on-Hadoop&reg;&quot; engine used for advanced data warehousing and analysis. Forest Hill, MD &mdash;27 October 2015&mdash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache&trade; Tajo&trade; v0.11.0, the advanced Open Source data warehousing system in Apache Hadoop&reg;. Apache Tajo provides the ability to rapidly extract more intelligence from Hadoop deployments, third party databases, and commercial business intelligence tools. Tajo 0.11.0 reflects numerous new features and improvements that include: Nested record type support ORC file support Improved ResultSet fetch performance of JDBC and TajoClient Tablespace support (similar to those of RDBMS) JDBC storage support and projection/filter push down, enabling Tajo to efficiently process RDBMS tables without ETL Multi-query support Python UDF/UDFA support Additionally, Tajo 0.11.0 includes improved join optimization, better query response, and nearly 350 bug fixes.&nbsp; &quot;Tajo 0.11.0 represents a very important milestone. It introduced critical features and functions that let us build out a modern data warehouse system,&quot; said Hyunsik Choi, Vice President of Apache Tajo and Research Director of Gruter Inc. &quot;Especially, query federation and tablespace features will help enterprise users easily integrate existing databases and NoSQL stores with Tajo, a Hadoop-based analytical system.&quot; &quot;Congratulations on Apache Tajo 0.11 release. As a leading online and mobile developer of the popular MMORPG game &lsquo;TERA&rsquo;, we process tons of log data to analyze various usage patterns,&quot; said Sung Min Ahn, head of Platform Development Department at Bluehole. &quot;We adopted Tajo in our game log analytics system for large scale data processing and Tajo made our works simple through its direct JSON data format support. Its ANSI SQL support also helped our data analysts to crunch the big data with no learning curve.&quot; &quot;After we adopted Apache Tajo to replace old Hive setup, the performance and stability of Tajo led us to expand its use to more mission-critical analysis workloads which we had depended on the commercial DW solution before. Tajo helps us to maintain our DW system in a more cost-efficient way,&quot; said Byunghwa Yun, R&amp;D Planning Team at Loen Entertainment. &quot;We are interested in the enhanced HBase tablespace support in Tajo 0.11. Data integration between various storages would be way easier.&quot; &quot;Wider Planet is the largest DSP company based in Korea. My team has been processing hundreds of terabytes data everyday with Hadoop and Hive. Thanks to our business growth, the size of data has been increasing rapidly and we have trouble in processing time and cost of servers,&quot; said Sudong Chung, CTO of Wider Planet, Inc., and a former Principal program manager at Microsoft China. &quot;I am glad that we tested Tajo, a promising alternative to Hive. Our test showed significant improvement in processing time and service reliability. Based on the test result, we are changing the plan of Hadoop footprint. I would highly recommend testing Tajo to serious Hive users.&quot; &quot;We provide the service that analyzes the usage patterns of electronic powers in houses and provides household customers with informative analysis results. We have used Apache Tajo for the analysis,&quot; said Young Park, Project Manager of R&amp;D Lab at Encored Technologies. &quot;We are pleased to see Tajo 0.11.0 release. It makes our jobs even more productive because Tajo is super fast and provides required features, such as UDF and multi query processing.&quot; Availability and Oversight Apache Tajo software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.
