<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br><br><br />
This project has a tradition of rotating the PMC Chair about every 2 years,<br />
to ensure continuity while at the same time preventing potential<br />
contributor burn-out.<br />
<br><br></p>
<p>Recently the PMC has undertaken the necessary actions for this and has<br />
found contributor (and PMC Member) <em>Shawn McKinney</em> willing and ready to take<br />
the gavel from <em>Stefan Seelmann</em> to head our great project, and the Board of<br />
the ASF has, in their meeting on Jan 16th 2019 (see [1], ratified the<br />
rotation.<br />
<br><br><br />
Please join me in thanking <em>Stefan Seelmann</em> for heading the project in 2017<br />
and 2018 and welcoming <em>Shawn McKinney</em> as the new PMC Chair and Vice<br />
President of the Apache Directory project.<br />
<br><br></p>

<br><br><br />
Best regards,<br />
<br><br><br />
Pierre Smits</p>
