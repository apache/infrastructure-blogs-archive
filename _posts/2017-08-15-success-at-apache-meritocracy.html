<div><strong><em>By Kevin A. McGrail</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Apache Software Foundation is not a democracy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It's an elitist organization that does not support an innate right to vote. We aren't capitalists because you can't buy a seat on our board. We aren't socialists since we place building working communities over software. Monarchy doesn't fit because Kings and Pawns work together as equals.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What we are is a Meritocracy. To be able to have a say, you have to prove your worth in a system of merit. Meritocracy is a key part of The Apache Way. With it, the ASF creates amazing software with amazing people that continues to change the way the world computes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Merit has no basis on Age, Sex, Religion, Ethnicity, Race, Country of Origin, Sexual Preference, Social Status, Income Level, Lineage, and/or Physical/Cultural Traits*.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In honor of The Apache Way, the ASF has created two wristbands to share with the tech community. The first is silver and announces our Meritocracy.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The second, because merit is NOT rooted in biological differences, is brash and bold in Red announcing "do I.T. like a girl". &nbsp;The idea comes from Code Like A Girl wristbands coupled with a small bit of double entendre to start a conversation about improving inclusion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you'd like some wristbands, they'll be debossed in a single color like the pictures below. Just send me an email at kmcgrail(at)apache(dot)org. I'll try and send out as many as I can for free. If you like/hate the idea, feel free to send me an email as well and tell me what you would do differently.</div>
