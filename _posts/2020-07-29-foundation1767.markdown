<p><b><i>World's largest Open Source foundation provides 227M+ lines of code, valued at more than $20B, to the public-at-large at 100% no cost.</i></b></p><p><b>Wakefield, MA —29 July 2020—</b> The Apache<sup>®</sup> Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of the annual report for its 2020 fiscal year (1 May 2019 - 30 April 2020).</p><p>Now in its 21st year, the world's largest Open Source foundation’s "Apache Way" of community-driven development is the proven process behind thousands of developers successfully collaborating on hundreds of Apache projects. The Apache Way has directly influenced the InnerSource methodology of applying Open Source and open development principles to an organization. The Apache Way has been adopted by countless organizations, including Capital One, Comcast, Ericsson, HP, IBM, Google, Microsoft, PayPal, SAP, T-Mobile, Walmart, and countless others.</p><p>Valued at more than $20B —and provided to the public-at-large at 100% no cost— Apache software is used in every Internet-connected country on the planet.</p><p>Apache software comprises 227M+ lines of code, is integral to nearly every end user computing device, manages exabytes of data, executes teraflops of operations, and stores billions of objects in virtually every industry. Countless mission-critical projects in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, build management, Cloud Computing, content management, DevOps, Deep Learning, IoT and Edge computing, mobile, servers, Web frameworks, and many other categories are powered by Apache.
