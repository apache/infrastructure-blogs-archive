<p> One major advantage of OpenOffice is that it is open source and that<br />
 the license allows you to use and install it as often you want. Once you<br />
have downloaded OpenOffice you can share it with as many other people as you like or install it on as many computers as<br />
you need. No limits!  </p></p>

<p>  The project likes to count downloads because high<br />
download numbers are our motivation and if you want they are the indirect payment<br />
 for all the volunteers. But we are also happy if you share your<br />
download with many other people or inside your company. If you do so<br />
please share your success stories of bigger deployments with us and we<br />
are happy to share your experience via our blog here. Keep in mind that<br />
sharing your experience, your success with other users in the community<br />
is also one kind of contribution to help the eco-system around<br />
OpenOffice growing.</p>
