<p>All Apache projects use the same pragmatic software license, the Apache<br />
License v2. However, we recognise that there are other FOSS licences out<br />
there, some of which are incompatible with the Apache License v2.</p>
<p>Code under these licenses cannot be hosted on Apache servers, but people<br />
sometimes choose to, or are required to, use them.</p>
<p>Until the launch of <a title="Apache Extras site" target="_blank" href="http://apache-extras.org">apache-extras</a> these projects had no a single<br />
home to go to. They were spread across all of the various hosting<br />
platforms. This made it difficult for communities to cluster around<br />
related technologies. For us this was a problem since we believe strong<br />
collaborative communities are the key to successful open source software.</p>
<p>Apache Extras provides these projects with a way to clearly signal their<br />
relationship to one or more Apache project community. This will help<br />
them attract developer communities to their own projects.</p>
