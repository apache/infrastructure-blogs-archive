<div>Hello, fellow Apache enthusiast. Thanks for your participation, and interest in, the projects of the Apache Software Foundation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wanted to remind you that the Call For Papers (CFP) for ApacheCon North America, and Apache: Big Data North America, closes in less than a month. If you've been putting it off because there was lots of time left, it's time to dig for that inspiration and get those talk proposals in.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It's also time to discuss with your developer and user community whether there's a track of talks that you might want to propose, so that you have more complete coverage of your project than a talk or two.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We're looking for talks directly, and indirectly, related to projects at the Apache Software Foundation. These can be anything from in-depth technical discussions of the projects you work with, to talks about community, documentation, legal issues, marketing, and so on. We're also very interested in talks about projects and services built on top of Apache projects, and case studies of how you use Apache projects to solve real-world problems.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are particularly interested in presentations from Apache projects either in the Incubator, or recently graduated. ApacheCon is where people come to find out what technology they'll be using this time next year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Important URLs are:</div>

<div>Early Bird registration rates end March 12th, but if you're a committer on an Apache project, you get the low committer rate, which is less than half of the early bird rate!</div>
