title: If it's not at apache.org, it's not from the Apache Software Foundation!

A number of websites have &quot;apache&quot; in their domain name, and sometimes pretend to be official sources of information about projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). How do you find out if it's the case?<br /><br />The rule is very simple: if a website is not hosted on an apache.org domain, it's not a website of the ASF (with a few exceptions, see below).<br /><br />In other words, if the site's address doesn't end with .apache.org, it's not ours. Note the dot before apache.org: fooapache.org or apachefoo.org wouldn't belong to us, whereas foo.apache.org does.<br /><br />The only exceptions to that rule are apachecon.com, which is jointly managed between<br />the ASF and companies producing our conferences, and spamassassin.org and myfaces.org, for historical reasons.<br /><br />So remember: if it's not at apache.org or one of the three above domains, it's not from us!
