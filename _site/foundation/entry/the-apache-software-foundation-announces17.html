<meta name="description" content="Big Data machine-learning library used for scalable in-database analytics Forest Hill, MD &ndash;22 August 2017&ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache&reg; MADlib&trade; has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project&#39;s community and products have been well-governed under the ASF&#39;s meritocratic process and principles. &lt;/p&gt; Apache MADlib is a comprehensive library for scalable in-database analytics. It provides parallel implementations of machine learning, graph, mathematical and statistical methods for structured and unstructured data. &quot;Graduating as a Top-Level Project is a very important milestone for Apache MADlib,&quot; said Aaron Feng, Vice President of Apache MADlib. &quot;During the incubation process, the MADlib community worked very hard to develop high quality software for in-database analytics, in an open and inclusive manner in accordance with the Apache Way.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; MADlib grew out of discussions between database engine developers, data scientists, IT architects and academics interested in new approaches to scalable, sophisticated in-database analytics. These discussions were written up in a paper from VLDB 2009 [1] that coined the term &quot;MAD Skills&quot; for data analysis. The MADlib software project began the following year as a collaboration between researchers at UC Berkeley and engineers and computer scientists at Pivotal (formerly EMC/Greenplum). In September 2015, MADlib joined the ASF community as an incubating project. MADlib is deployed on a wide variety of industry and academic projects across many different verticals, including automotive, consumer, finance, government, healthcare, and telecommunications. &quot;MADlib was conceived from the outset as an open-source meeting ground for software developers, computing researchers and data scientists to collaborate on scalable, in-database machine learning and statistics,&quot; said Joe Hellerstein, Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Trifacta, and one of the original authors of MADlib. &quot;It has been great to witness the growth of the MADlib community and codebase as an ASF incubating project, and I look forward to this continuing as a Top-Level Project.&quot; &quot;At Pivotal, we have seen our customers successfully deploy MADlib on large scale data science projects across a wide variety of industry verticals,&quot; said Elisabeth Hendrickson, Vice President, R&amp;D for Data at Pivotal. &quot;As MADlib graduates to a Top-Level Project at the ASF, we anticipate increased adoption in the enterprise given the mature level of the codebase and the active developer community.&quot; &quot;The potential of the Apache MADlib project is unbounded,&quot; said Jim Jagielski, Vice Chairman of the ASF. &quot;The ability to perform in-depth and detailed analytics, on both structured and unstructured data, using SQL enables MADlib to be applicable in scenarios where others simply can&#39;t compete. As not only interest in, but real-world usage of, machine learning becomes common place, MADlib joins the growing roster of Apache projects that define innovation.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &quot;Apache MADlib is a great example of the diversity at Apache,&quot; said Ted Dunning, Apache MADlib Incubator Mentor and Member of the ASF Board of Directors. &quot;MADlib does state-of-the-art machine learning, but does as an inherent part of a database. This is a radical approach that can provide important design flexibility. I am excited to see MADlib become a fully fledged project at Apache.&quot; &quot;New participants are more than welcome to join the project,&quot; added Feng. &quot;We enthusiastically look forward to working together with all contributors to Apache MADlib in order to advance the state-of-the-art of scale-out data science tools.&quot; [1] http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1687576 Availability and OversightApache MADlib software is released under the Apache License v2.0 and is overseen by a self-selected team of active contributors to the project.

<p>Apache MADlib is a comprehensive library for scalable in-database analytics. It provides parallel implementations of machine learning, graph, mathematical and statistical methods for structured and unstructured data.</p>
<p>"Graduating as a Top-Level Project is a very important milestone for Apache MADlib," said Aaron Feng, Vice President of Apache MADlib.
