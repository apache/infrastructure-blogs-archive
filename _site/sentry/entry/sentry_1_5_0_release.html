On July 16, the Apache Sentry community announced the release of Apache Sentry 1.5.1-incubating. Significant work has gone into this release which includes 8 major features, 18 improvements and 131 defects fixes. The following are the important features in this release: 1. Column-level access control: This feature provides the access control on column level support for the component such as HIVE. &nbsp; 2. More granular privileges to the DBModel: This feature adds more privilege types like CREATE, DROP, INDEX, LOCK etc.&nbsp; 3. High availability for Sentry service: Provide the option of running more redundant Sentry instances in the same cluster with a hot standby. This allows a fast failover to a new Sentry instance seamlessly in the case of outages. 4. Solr Sentry plug-in integration with DB store: Solr can persist the security policies into a database store like the hive plugin does. This new feature leverages the generic authorization model framework (which is also one new feature added in this release). &lt;/p&gt; The complete list of bugfixes, improvements and features in Sentry 1.5.1-incubating can be viewed at:&nbsp;http://s.apache.org/hVw Guoquan Shen (Release Manager)&lt;/p&gt; Note: Updated from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 release as 1.5.0 release was defuncted&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;" />
