    <p>Over 30 people&nbsp;attended the inaugural Sqoop Meetup on the eve of Hadoop World in NYC. Faces were put to names, troubleshooting tips were swapped, and stories were topped - with the table-to-end-all-tables weighing in at 28 billion rows.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>I&nbsp;started off the scheduled talks by discussing &quot;<a href="http://slidesha.re/sMiWeJ" title="Habits of Effective Sqoop Users">Habits of Effective Sqoop Users</a>.&quot; One tip to make your next debugging session more effective was to provide more information up front on the mailing list such as versions used and running with the --verbose flag enabled. Also, I pointed out workarounds to common MySQL and Oracle errors.</p> 
    <p>Next up was Eric Hernandez's &quot;<a href="http://slidesha.re/uFRlGk" title="Sqooping 50 Million Rows a Day from MySQL">Sqooping 50 Million Rows a Day from MySQL</a>,&quot; where he displayed battle scars from creating a single data source for analysts to mine. Key lessons learned were:&nbsp;(1.) Develop an incremental import when sqooping in large active tables.&nbsp;(2.) Limit the amount of parts that data will be stored in HDFS.&nbsp;(3.) Compress data in HDFS.</p>

    <p>The final talk of the night was given by Joey Echeverria on &quot;<a href="http://slidesha.re/taTWOY" title="How to Patch Sqoop">Scratching Your Own Itch</a>.&quot; Joey methodically stepped future Sqoop committers through the science from finding a Sqoop bug, filing a jira, coding a patch, submitting it for review, revising accordingly, and finally to ship it '+1' approval.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div>With the conclusion of the scheduled talks, the hallway talks commenced and went well into the night. Sqoop Committer&nbsp;Aaron Kimball was even rumored to have shed a tear over the healthy turnout and impending momentum barreling towards the next Sqoop Meetup on the Left Coast.&nbsp;See you there!</div>
