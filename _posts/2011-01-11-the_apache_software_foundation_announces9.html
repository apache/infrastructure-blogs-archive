<div><b><i>Highly-scalable Open Source Distributed Database for Handling Large Amounts of Data is a Key Component in Cloud Computing</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div>Forest Hill, MD &ndash; 11 January 2011 &ndash; The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache Cassandra v0.7, the highly-scalable, second generation Open Source distributed database.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Apache Cassandra is a key component in cloud computing and other applications that deal with massive amounts of data and high query volumes," said Jonathan Ellis, Vice President of Apache Cassandra. "It is particularly successful in powering large web sites with sharp growth rates."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Cassandra is successfully deployed at organizations with active data sets and large server clusters, including Cisco, Cloudkick, Digg, Facebook, Rackspace, and Twitter. The largest Cassandra cluster to date contains over 400 machines.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Running any large website is a constant race between scaling your user base and scaling your infrastructure to support it," said David King, Lead Developer at Reddit. "Our traffic more than tripled this year, and the transparent scalability afforded to us by Apache Cassandra is in large part what allowed us to do it on our limited resources. Cassandra v0.7 represents the real-life operations lessons&nbsp;learned from installations like ours and provides further features like column expiration that allow us to scale even more of our infrastructure."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Among the new features in Apache Cassandra v0.7 are:</div>
<div></div>
<div>- Secondary Indexes, an expressive, efficient way to query data through node-local storage on the client side;</div>
<div></div>
<div>- Large Row Support, up to two billion columns per row;</div>
<div></div>
<div>- Online Schema Changes &ndash; automated online schema changes from the client API allow adding and modifying object definitions without requiring a cluster restart.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Oversight and Availability</b></div>
<div>Apache Cassandra is available under the Apache Software License v2.0, and is overseen by a Project Management Committee (PMC), who guide its day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache Cassandra v0.7 downloads, documentation, and related resources are available at <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">http://cassandra.apache.org/</a>.</div>

<div><b>About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</b></div>
<div>Established in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees nearly one hundred fifty leading Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server &mdash; the world's most popular Web server software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way," more than 300 individual Members and 2,500 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide: thousands of software solutions are distributed under the Apache License; and the community actively participates in ASF mailing lists, mentoring initiatives, and ApacheCon, the Foundation's official user conference, trainings, and expo. The ASF is funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors including AMD, Basis Technology, Cloudera, Facebook, Google, IBM, HP, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, SpringSource, and Yahoo!.
