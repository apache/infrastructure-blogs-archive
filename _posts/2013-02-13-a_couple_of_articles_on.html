<p>A couple of articles on Apache Isis have just been published by the Software Developers Journal, available for <a href="http://sdjournal.org/software-developers-journal-open-012013-2/">free download</a>.</p>
<p>The first article is a general introduction to Apache Isis, while the second looks in detail at Isis' RESTful APIs. &nbsp;Both were written by Dan Haywood, Isis' current PMC chair.</p>
