<meta name="description" content="Since Yahoo! switched their DMARC policy in mid-April, we&#39;ve seen an increase in undeliverable messages sent from our mail server for Yahoo! accounts subscribed to our lists. &nbsp; Roughly half of Apache&#39;s mailing lists do some form of message munging, whether it be Subject header prefixes, appended message trailers, or removed mime components. &nbsp;Such actions are incompatible with Y!&#39;s policy for its users, which has meant more bounces and more frustration trying to maintain inclusive discussions with Y! users. Since Y!&#39;s actions are likely just the beginning of a trend towards strong DMARC policies aimed at eliminating forged emails, we&#39;ve taken the extraordinary step of munging Y! user&#39;s From headers to append a spec-compliant .INVALID marker on their address, and dropping the DKIM-Signature: header for such messages. &nbsp;We are an ezmlm shop and maintain a heavily customized .ezmlmrc file, so carrying this action out was relatively straightforward with a 30-line perl header filter prepended to certain lines in the &quot;editor&quot; block of our .ezmlmrc file. &nbsp;The filter does a dynamic lookup of DMARC &quot;p=reject&quot; policies to inform its actions, so we are prepared for future adopters beyond the early ones like Yahoo!, AOL, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. &nbsp; Interested parties in our solution may visit this page for details and the Apache-licensed code. Of course this filter only applies to half our lists- the remainder that do no munging are perfectly compatible with DMARC rejection policies without modification of our list software or configuration. &nbsp;Apache projects that prefer to avoid munging may file a Jira ticket with infrastructure to ask that their lists be set to &quot;ezmlm-make -+ -TXF&quot; options. &lt;/p&gt;" />
