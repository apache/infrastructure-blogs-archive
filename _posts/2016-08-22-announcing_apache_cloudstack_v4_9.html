<div><b>Forest Hill, MD &mdash;22 August 2016&mdash;</b> The Apache CloudStack project announced today the immediate availability of Apache CloudStack v4.9, the latest version of the turnkey Open Source Cloud computing software platform used for creating private, public, and hybrid Cloud environments.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apache CloudStack Clouds enable billions of dollars worth of business transactions annually across their Clouds. Its maturity, stability and ease of deployment has led it to become the Open Source platform of choice for many service providers offering on-demand, elastic public Cloud computing services. CloudStack is also leveraged by many enterprises to provide private or hybrid Clouds for use by their employees.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich APIs for managing the compute, networking, software, and storage infrastructure resources. It supports a broad range of integration points for both traditional and Cloud-native workloads.</p>
<div>"We're delighted to be releasing Apache CloudStack 4.9," said Will Stevens, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. "This version brings many new and exciting features, with the continued emphasis on making Apache CloudStack the easiest Cloud platform to deploy and most reliable platform for running IaaS environments. This release is the culmination of many months of hard work by our diverse developer community."</div>
<div></div>
<div>CloudStack 4.9 reflects dozens of new features and improvements, including:</div>

<div>
<p>"Apache CloudStack has been at the very foundation of Telia CLOUDY SERVICES already for more than 3 years," said Mārtiņ&scaron; Paurs, CCO of CLOUDY SERVICES by Telia Latvia. "After starting with regular IaaS services, during time it has taken over orchestration of Cloud based video surveillance, CDN and video lifecycle management workloads, all for the benefit of our customers. And CloudStack does it really well! The ease of use, stability, professional and community support, powerful features &nbsp;and scale we can achieve by using CloudStack has turned upside down the way and pace we innovate together with the very demanding market."</p>
<p>"cloud.ca is an avid supporter of Apache CloudStack not only because we value the stability and robustness of the platform, but because we highly value the power of the CloudStack community to drive innovation," said Mike Gero, Vice President of Product &amp; Business Development at cloud.ca.
