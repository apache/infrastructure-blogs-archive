<p>Here, at last, is a community space for everyone working on Apache NetBeans, currently incubating, to post blogs. </p>

<p>I imagine this will be a place where we can announce new releases of Apache NetBeans, while it will also be a place for everyone to share their experiences and make all kinds of other announcements.</p>

<p>For example, did you know there's already an application created on top of Apache NetBeans? <a href="https://jaxenter.com/netbeans/yameter-cloud-load-testing-everybody">It is called YaMeter, read about it here.</a></p>

<p>Happy blogging everyone, at the brand new Apache NetBeans (incubating) blog.</p>
