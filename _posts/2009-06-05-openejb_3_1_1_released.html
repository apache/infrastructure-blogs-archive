<p>The Apache OpenEJB team is excited to announce the release of <a href="http://openejb.apache.org/openejb-311.html">OpenEJB 3.1.1</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes some great enhancements for the embedded testing scenarios and general EJB programming.  Notable improvements include:</p>
<p>  - Dependency injection for test cases and clients of the embedded ejb container via new @LocalClient annotation.<br />
  - Support for annotating the same interface as @Local, @Remote and @WebService making it possible to exposing all possible EJB views with a single interface.<br />
  - Web Service views securable with @RolesAllowed, @PermitAll and @DenyAll annotations.<br />
  - Ability to easily use alternate sets of deployment descriptors for some or all tests via new 'openejb.altdd.prefix' property.<br />
  - Global lookups from any context simplified via new "openejb:" jndi namespace.</p>
<p>The release also contains several new examples including Applets invoking EJBs in webapps, Struts with JPA and EJB, secured web services and web services with Perl SOAP::Lite clients and more.</p>
