We are very excited to announce the release of <strong>Apache Samza 0.13.1</strong><br />
Samza has been powering real-time applications in production across several large companies (including LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber) for years now. Samza provides leading support for large-scale stateful stream processing with:
<ul>
<li>First class support for local state (with RocksDB store). This allows a stateful application to scale up to 1.1 Million events/sec on a single machine with SSD.</li>
<li>Support for incremental checkpointing of state instead of full snapshots. This enables Samza to scale to applications with very large state.</li>
<li>A fully pluggable model for input sources (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB streams etc.) and output systems (HDFS, Kafka, ElastiCache etc.).</li>
<li>A fully asynchronous programming model that makes parallelizing remote calls efficient and effortless.</li>
<li>High level API for expressing complex stream processing pipelines in few lines of code.</li>
<li>Flexible deployment model for running the the applications in any hosting environment and with cluster managers other than YARN.</li>
<li>Features like canaries, upgrades and rollbacks that support extremely large deployments with minimal downtime.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Community Developments</h3>
We’ve made great community progress since the last release (0.13.0). We presented Samza high level API features at the Cloud+Data NEXT Conference 2017 held in Silicon Valley, USA, and also gave a talk regarding the key features (Secret Kung Fu) of Samza at ArchSummit 2017 in Shenzhen, China, and a detailed study of stateful stream processing in VLDB 2017. Here are the details to these conferences.
