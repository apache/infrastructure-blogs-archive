<p>We (the Apache MRUnit team) have just graduated from the Apache Incubator to an Apache TLP (Top Level Project)! MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.</p>
<p>In its monthly meeting in May of 2012, the board of Apache Software Foundation (ASF) resolved to grant a Top-Level Project status to Apache MRUnit, thus graduating it from the Incubator. This is a significant milestone in the life of MRUnit, which has come a long way since its inception as a Hadoop Contrib project in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5518">HADOOP-5518</a> contributed by Aaron Kimball.</p>
<ul>
<li>May 2012 MRUnit graduates from the Incubator to become a TLP</li>
<li>May 2012 Version 0.9.0-incubating released.</li>
<li>April 2012 Dave Beech added as a new committer.</li>
<li>April 2012 Jarek Jarcec Cecho added as a new committer.</li>
<li>April 2012 New website created using the CMS.</li>
<li>March 2012 Version 0.8.1-incubating released.</li>
<li>March 2012 Jim Donofrio added as a new committer.</li>
<li>Feburary 2012 Version 0.8.0-incubating released.</li>
<li>November 2011 Version 0.5.0-incubating released.</li>
<li>October 2011 Brock Noland added as a new committer.</li>
<li>March 2011 Project enters incubation.</li>
<li>April 2009 Doug Cutting commits Aaron's patch to Hadoop</li>
<li>March 2009 Aaron Kimball contributes MRunit to Hadoop as a contrib project</li>
</ul>
