<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">The Apache Software Foundation is happy
to announce BarCampApache Sydney, Australia, the first ASF-backed event in
the Southern Hemisphere! 
</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Taking place 11th December 2010 at the
University of Sydney's Darlington Centre, the BarCampApache
&quot;unconference&quot; will be attendee-driven, facilitated by members of
the Apache community and will focus on the “Apache Way” of
developing software. The event is open to the public free of charge.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Those interested in using Apache
products, how projects are developed within the ASF, open development
techniques and best practices, Web 2.0-style data mashups, engaging
with The Apache Software Foundation, and the general BarCamp
experience are welcome to participate.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As the Apache community comprises
thousands of committed individuals from around the world, there are
always opportunities for attendees to help. And with all BarCamps,
BarCampApache Sydney seeks active participation at all levels,
including assisting with the physical set up to pre-event promotion
to proposing discussion topics and blogging/tweeting during the
event.</p> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">BarCampApache Sydney sponsors include
the University of Sydney, Alfresco, IBM, and MaestroDev. Sponsorship
opportunities are available. For more information, contact Brett
