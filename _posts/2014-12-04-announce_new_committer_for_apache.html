<p>
I'm delighted to announce that Martin Grigorov has been voted in as a committer on <a href="http://isis.apache.org/">Apache Isis</a>, and also as a member of the Isis PMC.  The first gives Martin the right to commit changes directly to Isis' codebase, the second gives him the right to be involved in future votes.</p>
<p>Martin is already a <a href="https://github.com/apache/wicket/graphs/contributors">key committer</a> on the&nbsp;http://wicket.apache.org/&nbsp;project, as well as <a href="https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap/graphs/contributors">actively contributing</a> to the companion <a href="https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-bootstrap">Wicket-bootstrap</a> project. &nbsp;If you're a subscriber to the <a href="http://isis.apache.org/support.html">Isis mailing lists</a>&nbsp;you also wouldn't have failed to have noticed his involvement in users and dev lists recently.</p>
<p>Initially Martin got involved because Jeroen and I asked him to help <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-537">bootstrappify</a>&nbsp;the Wicket viewer.  Even though that piece of work is substantially complete, Martin continues to be actively involved, providing patches and working on other tickets, and from speaking with him I know he's keen to get involved with all aspects of Isis, not just the Wicket viewer.  For recent contributions, check out these <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/graphs/contributors">github statistics</a> [6] and his <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mgrigorov">activity stream</a> on JIRA.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to working with Martin in the future; another great addition to Isis' committers.  So please join me in welcoming him to our happy band!</p>
