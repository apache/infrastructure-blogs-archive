<meta name="description" content="ApacheCon this year will expand content and networking opportunities for thousands of developers and users working on more than 100 open source software projects SAN FRANCISCO, January 14, 2014 &ndash; The Linux Foundation and The Apache Software Foundation today announced they will join forces to advance and support open source development by co-producing this year&#39;s ApacheCon event, which hosts collaboration on some of the today&#39;s hottest open source projects, including Apache projects like Cassandra, Cordova, CloudStack, CouchDB, Geronimo, Hadoop, Hive, HTTP Server, Lucene, OpenOffice, Struts, Subversion and Tomcat, among many others. This year&#39;s event will also be co-located with CloudStack Collaboration Conference North America. ApacheCon, now in its 15th year, will expand content and create new experiences for attendees with more opportunities for collaboration and networking.

<div><b><i>ApacheCon this year will expand content and networking opportunities for thousands of developers and users working on more than 100 open source software projects</i></b></div>
<div><b><i><br /></i></b></div>
<div>SAN FRANCISCO, January 14, 2014 &ndash; The Linux Foundation and The Apache Software Foundation today announced they will join forces to advance and support open source development by co-producing this year's ApacheCon event, which hosts collaboration on some of the today's hottest open source projects, including Apache projects like Cassandra, Cordova, CloudStack, CouchDB, Geronimo, Hadoop, Hive, HTTP Server, Lucene, OpenOffice, Struts, Subversion and Tomcat, among many others. This year's event will also be co-located with CloudStack Collaboration Conference North America.</div>
<div></div>
<div>ApacheCon, now in its 15th year, will expand content and create new experiences for attendees with more opportunities for collaboration and networking. It will take place April 7-9, 2014 and CloudStack Collaboration Conference North America will take place April 9-11, 2014 in Denver, Colorado at the Westin in Downtown Denver. Call for Papers (CFP) for both events are open now and close February 10, 2014.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Linux Foundation's mission is to advance Linux and open source collaborative software. By hosting and organizing community events it can bring together the people who are building the software that runs our lives and help advance their work. The organization to date has hosted and produced more than 50 world-class events, including the annual LinuxCon and CloudOpen conferences, and has produced events for communities and community projects such as Gluster, KVM, the Linux Plumbers Conference, Linux Kernel Summit, Linux Storage, Filesystem and Memory Management Summit, OpenDaylight Summit, Tizen Developer Conference, Xen User &amp; Developer Summit, and many more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Linux Foundation provides these important event services to community organizations that seek to advance open source technologies through collaboration and will help support the work of the Apache Software Foundation, its developer community and the larger open source ecosystem by producing ApacheCon.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"The Linux Foundation strives to provide unique, collaborative experiences at its events. Our focus is on enabling community and facilitating the relationships that will benefit this form of development for years to come," said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. "By working with The Apache Software Foundation and its community, we can use our expertise in events to benefit more open source projects and the broader ecosystem at large."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"The Linux Foundation has demonstrated its expertise in hosting events around the world for a wide variety of open source project communities," said Rich Bowen, executive vice president of The Apache Software Foundation and ApacheCon North America 2014 chair.

<div><b><i>ApacheCon Brings Together Hundreds of Projects, Thousands of Developers</i></b></div>
<div>ApacheCon is the only event dedicated to bringing together the 100+ Apache Software Foundation project communities as well as other open source projects across multiple sectors in one venue to advance the work that is defining the future of technology and that represents a new generation of software development. Famously referenced in Thomas Friedman's book, "The World is Flat," Apache, like Linux, gave way to a flurry of innovation based on collaborative development. Today, it is this approach to building software that is changing the world in which we live.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Keynotes, conference sessions, hackathons, lightening talks, a Bar Camp and tutorials are among the activities and formats in which attendees will be able to participate and interact with the maintainers and influencers from these technology communities. This year&rsquo;s program will increase the number of tracks from five in 2013 to nine in 2014 and will include project-specific tracks. A number of Apache projects will host their own hackathons, developer days or mini-summits onsite. Evening events and a closing game will provide attendees the opportunity to mingle and get to know other community members.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Early bird registration is available through January 31, 2014 at the special rate of US$799, after which the standard fee of US$1099 will apply through March 14, 2014.
