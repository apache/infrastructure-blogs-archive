<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html" title="ASF Incorporation">ASF<br />
incorporator</a> and founding Chairman Roy Fielding reminded <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/members.html" title="ASF Members">us</a> of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#why" title="ASF Mission">ASF&rsquo;s<br />
mission</a> as created ten years ago.</p>
<p>ASF Board member Bertrand Delacretaz then suggested we post<br />
it here on the ASF blog to reinforce the fact that, in spite of its tremendous<br />
growth, the ASF hasn&rsquo;t strayed from its roots; still remaining true to its<br />
original vision. We couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Here&rsquo;s to the next 10 years!</p>
