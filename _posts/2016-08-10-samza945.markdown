<p>I am excited to announce that the <a href="http://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a> 0.10.1 has been released. This is our <i>fourth</i> release as an Apache Top-level Project! 

<br /><br />
Apache Samza is a distributed stream-processing framework that uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. It was originally created at LinkedIn and still continues to be used in production. The project is currently under active development with contributions from a diverse group of contributors and committers. Samza still continues to be used in production by many companies (such as Netflix, Uber, TripAdvisor etc. See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMZA/Powered+By">PoweredBy</a>) in the industry. 
</p>

<p>A source download of the 0.10.1 release is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/samza/0.10.1">here</a>. The release JARs are also available in <a href="https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/samza/">Apache's Maven repository</a>. See Samza's <a href="http://samza.apache.org/startup/download/">download</a> page for details. </p>

<p>
Overall, 72 JIRAs were <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SAMZA%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D0.10.1%20ORDER%20BY%20updated%20DESC">resolved</a> in this release. This is a minor release consisting of some bug-fixes and robust improvements to features like coordinator stream, host-affinity etc. Samza continues to require <i>Java 1.7+</i> and <i>Yarn 2.6.1+</i>.

A few notable enhancements are:
<ul>
  <li>Support static partition assignment in ProcessJobFactory (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-41">SAMZA-41</a>) </li>
  <li>Slow start of Samza jobs with large number of containers (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-843">SAMZA-843</a>) </li>
