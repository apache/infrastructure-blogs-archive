<p>The Apache Software Foundation is <a href="http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">participating</a> in GSoC again this
year, and CouchDB is on the project list of course!</p>

<p>By the end of the summer, we hope you've above all, had fun, and we've
enabled you to make a valued contribution, and ideally help you
continue in your involvement with the CouchDB project.</p>

<h4>I'm a student, how do I start?</h4>

<p>Check out some of the <a href="http://s.apache.org/couchdb_gsoc2013">ideas</a>  or suggest your own ones.
Please <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@couchdb.apache.org">subscribe</a> to our <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-list">developer mailing list</a> and join us on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/couchdb-dev">IRC</a>
at #couchdb-dev on <code>irc.freenode.net</code> to talk about what you're interested
in. Don't forget to read the <a href="http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">ASF GsOC guide</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need to pick your projects and submit proposals from 22nd April
to 3rd May.</p>

<h4>I'm interested in being a mentor for the CouchDB project!</h4>

<p>Thanks! Please read up on being a <a href="http://community.apache.org/guide-to-being-a-mentor.html">mentor</a> and contact
<a href="mailto:dev@couchdb.apache.org?subject=gsoc">dev@couchdb.apache.org</a> for more details. Previous mentors suggest the effort is around
5h per week on average. Please review the topics list and feel free to
make any adjustments.</p>

<p>Please pass this on to your local user groups, universities, etc. Thanks!</p>
