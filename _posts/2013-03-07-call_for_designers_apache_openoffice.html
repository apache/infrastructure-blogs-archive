    to find them. I'd suggest having some designers look at ideas to get some inspiration.
    :)\r\n\r\nVery excited about the rebranding. Hope to see a more elegant Office
    Suite. Appearances can really sell an open source product. "

<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> is looking for a refreshed logo and branding for its upcoming 4.0 release.</p>
<p><img align="middle" src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/19b19fa0-f51b-4c42-aa7d-ceb8d0d9aa62" alt="logo-contest-600.png" /> </p>
<p>This is a tremendous opportunity for designers to get involved in one of the most popular free and open source projects, and to get their work displayed to dozens of million of users: Apache OpenOffice just celebrated 40 million downloads in less than ten months.</p>
<h3>Brand Refresh Project Scope</h3>
<p>Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>An AOO Logo</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be altered for use in splash screens, about screens, publications, website, elements in application icons, etc.</li>
<li>Brand proposals that show more than just a logo, considering placement in the areas of focus such as splash screen and websites.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Primary Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Logo submissions must include the source.</li>
<li>Logos can be as large as the designer wishes, but must be able to<br />
scale down and not loose detail. eg.. for website, splash screen, etc.</li>
<li>Although text in the logo is optional, any font used must be a free<br />
 and open font. eg. SIL Open Source Fonts.&nbsp; Any font used in the logo<br />
must be disclosed upon submission.</li>
<li>Incorporation of gulls literally or symbolically, but not necessarily the existing shape used in current branding.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested, please read the full <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Apache+OpenOffice+4.0+Brand+Refresh+Project">Brand Refresh Project page</a> (including the "child pages" at the bottom) to get more background, see what other volunteers  are proposing and learn how you can contribute!</p>
