This is an archive of the [Roller](https://roller.apache.org/) blogs that were previously hosted on 
[blogs.apache.org](https://blogs.apache.org).  The official Apache news site
is located at [news.apache.org](https://news.apache.org/)

Many projects have migrated their blogs to other hosts; however, we do not have an up-to-date list of where the active blogs are. If you are interested in a particular project, there is a good chance you will find a link to the project blog on the project's website. For example, the Infrastructure website has a link to the Infra blog at <a href="https://infra.apache.org/blog/" target="_blank">infra.apache.org/blog</a>.
