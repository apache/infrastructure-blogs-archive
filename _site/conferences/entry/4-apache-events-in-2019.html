The roadshow is a full day of technical talks (two tracks) and an open source job fair featuring AWS, Bloomberg, dito, GridGain, Linode, and Security University. More details about the program, the job fair, and to register, visit https://apachecon.com/usroadshowdc19/ Apache Roadshow Chicago will be held May 13-14th at a number of venues in Chicago&rsquo;s Logan Square neighborhood. This event will feature sessions in AdTech, FinTech and Insurance, startups, &ldquo;Made in Chicago&rdquo;, Project Shark Tank (innovations from the Apache Incubator), community diversity, and more. It&rsquo;s a great way to learn about various Apache projects &ldquo;at work&rdquo; while playing at a brewery, a beercade, and a neighborhood bar. Sign up today at https://www.apachecon.com/chiroadshow19/ We&rsquo;re delighted to announce that the Call for Presentations (CFP) is now open for ApacheCon North America in Las Vegas, September 9-13th! As the official conference series of the ASF, ApacheCon North America will feature over a dozen Apache project summits, including Cassandra, Cloudstack, Tomcat, Traffic Control, and more. We&rsquo;re looking for talks in a wide variety of categories -- anything related to ASF projects and the Apache development process. The CFP closes at midnight on May 12th. In addition, the ASF will be celebrating its 20th Anniversary during the event. For more details and to submit a proposal for the CFP, visit https://apachecon.com/acna19/ .

In addition to innovative content from our projects, we are collaborating with the Open Source Design community (https://opensourcedesign.net/) to offer a track on design this year. The CFP and registration will open soon at https://apachecon.com/aceu19/ .
