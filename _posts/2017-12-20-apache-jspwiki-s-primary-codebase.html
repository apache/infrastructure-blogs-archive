The change was enacted after a vote on the JSPWiki user's mailing list (with the results summarised <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jspwiki-user/201712.mbox/%3CCAMufup4cxVGGtgNF2n6xixfnJroBi0N1ujbAS7YbWxTBp3YKaA%40mail.gmail.com%3E" target="_blank" title="Results of the vote to move JSPWiki repos to GitHub">here</a>).</p>
