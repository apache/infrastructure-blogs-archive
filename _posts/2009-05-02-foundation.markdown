<p>Not only does the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" title="Apache HTTP Server">Apache HTTP Server</a> power <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/04/06/april_2009_web_server_survey.html" title="Netcraft Survey">more
than 106 million Websites</a> worldwide, an astounding 89% of Linux
Journal readers have chosen the “competitor-less” Apache HTTP Server as their
favorite Web server, according to the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-journal-announces-winners-its-2009-readers-choice-awards" title="Linux Journal Reader's Choice Awards">2009
Reader’s Choice Awards</a>.</p>

<p>We were tickled to read, “As with last year, the thought
arises in Favorite Web Server category of whether we should just ask ‘Do you
use the Apache Web server, yes or no?’ and leave it at that.” According to
Associate Publisher Mark Irgang, “Apache is always in there.” </p>

<p>Congratulations to the Apache
HTTP Server Project for more than 16 years of technical
excllence!</p>
