<div><b><i>Apache has been at the forefront of dozens of today's industry-defining technologies and tools; nearly every end-user computing device has been touched by at least one Apache product.</i></b></div> 
  <p><b>Budapest, Hungary –19 November–</b> At ApacheCon Europe, members of the Apache community commemorated The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)'s fifteenth anniversary and congratulated the people, projects, initiatives, and organizations that played a role in its success.</p> 
  <div> 
    <p>Recognized as the leader in community-led Open Source software development, the ASF was established to shepherd, develop, and incubate Open Source innovations &quot;The Apache Way&quot;. Reflections on achievements over the past 15 years include:</p> 
    <p> </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>ASF @ 15 Statement by Chairman Brett Porter <a href="http://s.apache.org/RYD">http://s.apache.org/RYD</a></li> 
      <li>Sponsorship and Stewardship by President Ross Gardler <a href="http://s.apache.org/oLh">http://s.apache.org/oLh</a></li> 
      <li>Community Over Code by Executive Vice President Rich Bowen <a href="http://s.apache.org/AQJ">http://s.apache.org/AQJ</a></li> 
    </ul> 
    <p><br />Apache products power half the Internet, manage exabytes of data, execute teraflops of operations, store billions of objects in virtually every industry, and enhance the lives of countless users and developers worldwide. Apache projects power mission-critical applications in financial services, aerospace, publishing, big data, Cloud computing, mobile, government, healthcare, research, infrastructure, development frameworks, foundational libraries, and many other categories. Beginning with the Apache HTTP Server —the world's most popular Web server— Apache software has been at the forefront of dozens of today's industry-defining technologies and tools, playing an integral role in nearly every end-user computing device, from laptops to tablets to mobile phones.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>Apache software is so ubiquitous that 50% of the top 10 downloaded Open Source products are Apache projects. The commercially-friendly and permissive Apache License v2 has become an industry standard within the Open Source world. The Apache License and open development model are widely recognized as among the best ways to ensure open standards gain traction and adoption. The ASF offers a vendor-neutral space in which to collaborate whilst enabling third parties to pursue almost any for-profit or not-for-profit business model. To date, hundreds of thousands of software solutions have been distributed under the Apache License.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p> </p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
    <p>Amazingly, this is achieved by an all-volunteer community comprising 505 individual Members and 4,081 Apache Committers collaborating across six continents. The ASF's day-to-day operating expenses are offset by the generous sponsorship of individual donors and corporate sponsors including Citrix, Cloudera, Comcast, Facebook, Google, Hortonworks, HP, IBM, Matt Mullenweg, Microsoft, and Yahoo.</p> 
    <p> </p>
