    amendment here is that each of those domain names are getting redirected to an
    ASF-owned DNS entry and thus everything ends up in an .apache.org domain name
    scheme anyway."

  content: "Note that the ASF does use a very few Twitter handles for official announcements
    (@TheASF and @ApacheCon) - and we also have a select few Groups/Pages/Events and
    the like on various social networking sites.\r\n\r\nIn each case, it should be
    obvious that the groups or IDs really are official - they will have numerous links
    directly back to official apache.org or apachecon.com sites and the like.  If
    in doubt, always check first!"

<p>A number of websites have "apache" in their domain name, and sometimes pretend to be official sources of information about projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). How do you find out if it's the case?</p>
<p>The rule is very simple: if a website is not hosted on an apache.org domain, it's not a website of the ASF (with a few exceptions, see below).</p>
<p>In other words, if the site's address doesn't end with .apache.org, it's not ours. Note the dot before apache.org: fooapache.org or apachefoo.org wouldn't belong to us, whereas foo.apache.org does.</p>
<p>The only exceptions to that rule are apachecon.com, which is jointly managed between<br />the ASF and companies producing our conferences, and spamassassin.org and myfaces.org, for historical reasons.</p>
<p>So remember: if it's not at apache.org or one of the three above domains, it's not from us!</p>
