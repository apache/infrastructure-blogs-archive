It also includes several command line utilities, including encrypt, decrypt, overlay, debugger, merger, PDFToImage, and TextToPDF. Apache PDFBox software is released under the Apache License v2.0, and is overseen by a self-selected volunteer team of active contributors to the project. A Project Management Committee (PMC) guides the Project&#39;s day-to-day operations, including community development and product releases.
