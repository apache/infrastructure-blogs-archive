  Sqoop Meetup</a> last week at Cloudera HQ in Palo Alto. About 20 of the Meetup attendees
  had not used Sqoop before, but were interested enough to participate in the Meetup
  on April 4th. We believe this healthy interest in Sqoop will contribute to its wide
  adoption. </span></b>Not only was this Sqoop''s second Meetup but also a celebration
  for Sqoop''s graduation from the Incubator, cementing its status as a Top-Level
  Project in the Apache Software Foundation.</span></b>'
