<p>Welcome to our monthly blog update about what is happening in Apache Community Development (ComDev)!  </p>
<p>This month we have news about our Apache EU Roadshow, the schedule for Apachecon North America is announced, we talk about our participation at GOTO Chicago, we plan for having an Apache presence at more open source conferences and we welcome another PMC member.</p>
<h2>OpenExpo Europe</h2>
<p>As part of our involvement with the  <a href="https://openexpoeurope.com/" target="external">OpenExpo Europe Conference</a> there was a request for volunteers to write short articles on open source trends for the conference e-book. Several volunteers came forward and the ebook was published in both  <a href="https://s.apache.org/wTcp" target="external">English</a> and <a href="https://s.apache.org/xxYP" target="external">Spanish</a> versions. Thanks very much to everyone who contributed and also to Sally Khudairi for co-ordination.</p>
<p>Ignasi Barrera has taken over the event co-ordination and a  <a href="https://s.apache.org/cDT6" target="external">wiki page</a> has been setup to track the details. We will have a keynote and several other presentations at the event, as well as being part of informal question and answer sessions.</p>
<p>We will also have our Apache booth available at  the event. If you will be attending the event or would like to help out as part of our presence at the event then please contact us via the <a href="https://s.apache.org/qdrd">community developmen mailing list</a>.</p>
<h2>Apache EU Roadshow</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://s.apache.org/ifff" target="external"> Apache EU Roadshow </a> will be co-located with <a href="https://foss-backstage.de/" target="external"> FOSS Backstage </a>on 13th and 14th June 2018 in Berlin. The CFP for the Roadshow ended with 72 talks being submitted. A request for reviewers was made via our mailing list and we found several volunteers who were happy to help us select the presentations for our roadshow tracks.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apachecon.com/euroadshow18/schedule.html">schedule has been announced</a> and we have a full program of 28 talks. We have 2 days filled with new and exciting presentations. Join us to learn the latest about Apache Tomcat, IoT, Cloud technologies, Micro-services and Apache Httpd Server. The main dates and details are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Monday 11th - Thursday 14th June 2018 </strong>: Apache Lounge and Booth, available for networking, hacking and community meetups<br />
<strong>Wednesday 13th June 2018</strong>; <a href="https://s.apache.org/5xmn">Track 1: Cloud</a> ; <a href="https://s.apache.org/xAGQ">Track 2: Apache Tomcat</a><br />
<strong>Thursday 14th June 2018</strong>;<a href="https://s.apache.org/NCMF"> Track 1: Apache Httpd and Microservices</a> ; <a href="https://s.apache.org/0lO5"> Track 2; Internet of Things (IoT)</a></p>
<p>Registering to attend FOSS Backstage will also give you access to the Apache EU Roadshow. Please note that this will be the main Apache event in Europe for 2018 so we are hoping that as many people from our project communities are able to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> that many Community related, governance or Apache Way presentations have been included as part of the FOSS Backstage program.</p>
<p>You can find out more information about the EU Roadshow and also and register to attend at  <a href="https://s.apache.org/ifff" target="external">  http://apachecon.com/euroadshow18 </a> and more about FOSS Backstage at <a href="https://foss-backstage.de " target="external"> https://foss-backstage.de</a></p>
<h2>ApacheCon NA Schedule Announced</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce our schedule for <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18" target="external"> ApacheCon North America 2018 </a> will be held September 23-27 at the Montreal Marriott Chateau Champlain in Montreal, Canada. Our CFP ended with nearly 250 submissions and we have selected more than 100 of them for the conference. The <a href="http://apachecon.com/acna18/" target="external">schedule is now live</a>  and includes full tracks from Apache Cloudstack, Apache Tomcat and our GeoSpatial community.</p>

And if your company wants to sponsor this event, get in touch at help@apachecon.com for opportunities that are still available.</p>
<h2>GOTO Chicago</h2>
<p>We were allocated a free booth at<br />
<a href="https://gotochgo.com/" target="external">GOTO Chicago </a> which was staffed by several community members. Kanchana Welagedara, Bob Paulin, and Trevor Grant worked the booth for two days and were able to engage with several developers who are interested in getting involved with projects.  Most of the participants knew about the ASF (which is great!), although a few thought that we were trying to sell something (which is great because we made them aware of who the ASF is / what it's goals are).</p>
<p>The most important conversations revolved around</p>
<ol>
<li>There are ALOT of Apache Projects and;</li>
<li>projects are made up of ordinary people and to not be intimidated about getting involved and contributing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GOTO event organisers were excited to have us at the event, and would like to have the ASF do booths at other conferences in the future. Finally, another great outcome of the event was a <a href="https://s.apache.org/4wWF" target="external"> proposal to have an Apache Roadshow Chicago in Spring of 2019. </a> This has been taken back to our mailing list and planning has already begun!</p>
<p>Huge thanks very much to Trevor Grant for taking the lead on managing our participation at this event, and to all the other volunteers who participated and helped promote Apache. Remember, if you are interested in being involved or helping out then please join the discussion on our <a href="https://s.apache.org/qdrd"> mailing list</a>.</p>
<h2>OSCON 2018</h2>
<p>We have been allocated a free booth at <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or" target="external"> OSCON.</a> It has been a while since we had a presence there but this year the OSCON schedule includes quite a few talks related to Apache projects. Taking a quick look through the schedule you will find presentations on Spark, OpenWhisk, Kafka, PredictionIO, Ignite, MXNet, Mesos and Fineract. It is great to see our projects being promoted at this type of event.</p>
<h2>GSoC</h2>
<p>The ASF was accepted as a GSoC mentor organisation again this year and our mentors mailing list is being used to co-ordinate the work. Both Uli and Maxim have been very active in finalising the list of accepted students.</p>
<h2>Welcome New PMC Member - Maxim Solodovnik</h2>
<p>The Apache Community Development PMC is pleased to announce another new PMC member this month. Maxim Solodovnik has been involved with community development activities for a while and has also been helping us administer and support GSoC. Maxim has shown himself to be very open, enthusiastic and willing to share his knowledge with others. </p>
<p>We are sure that Maxim will be a great addition to the ComDev PMC.</p>
